34136652,Mixology: a Mixology tool for calculating required masses and volumes for laboratory solutions.,"Laboratory Mixology Mixology work often requires making up solutions with defined concentrations of various components. Mixology is a tool we have created to simplify calculation of the masses and volumes required to obtain particular concentrations. It operates with many kinds of volumetric, mass and concentration units, including conversion between molarity- and mass-based concentrations using molecular masses retrieved from the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) database. Mixology can be accessed at https://mixology.mixology.science.",https://mixology.Mixology.science.
34179956,The DNA methylation haplotype (mHap) format and mHapTools.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) is currently the gold standard for measuring genome-wide DNA methylation profiles at single-nucleotide resolution. Most analyses focus on mean CpG methylation and ignore methylation states on the same DNA fragments [DNA methylation haplotypes (mHaps)]. Here, we propose mHap, a simple DNA mHap format for storing DNA BS-seq data. This format reduces the size of a BAM file by 40- to 140-fold while retaining complete read-level CpG methylation information. It is also compatible with the Tabix tool for fast and random access. We implemented a command-line tool, mHapTools, for converting BAM/SAM files from existing platforms to mHap files as well as post-processing DNA methylation data in mHap format. With this tool, we processed all publicly available human reduced representation bisulfite sequencing data and provided these data as a comprehensive mHap database.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://jiantaoshi.github.io/mHap/index.html.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",https://jiantaoshi.github.io/mHap/index.html.<h4>Supplementary

31991337,FrogAncestryCalc: A standalone batch likelihood computation tool for ancestry inference panels catalogued in FROG-kb.,"The web-based application, FROG-kb (the Forensic Resource/Reference on Genetics-knowledge base, https://frog.med.yale.edu) supports the use of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) for individual identification and ancestry inference in a forensic setting. The primary functionality provided by FROG-kb on the web is computation of relative likelihoods of populations being the origin of an individual, utilizing the underlying reference population allele frequency data curated and organized in ALFRED, the ALlele FREquency Database (https://alfred.med.yale.edu/). Here we present a downloadable stand-alone tool, FrogAncestryCalc that can simultaneously compute population likelihoods for multiple individuals for a selected panel of SNPs. The program calculates for a given Ancestry Inference (AI) panel the probability of each individual's genotype profile arising in each of the reference populations. Five of the AI panels catalogued in FROG-kb are implemented in this version of FrogAncestryCalc.",https://frog.med.yale.edu)
33963869,ProteoSign v2: a faster and evolved user-friendly online tool for statistical analyses of differential proteomics.,"Bottom-up proteomics analyses have been proved over the last years to be a powerful tool in the characterization of the proteome and are crucial for understanding cellular and organism behaviour. Through differential proteomic analysis researchers can shed light on groups of proteins or individual proteins that play key roles in certain, normal or pathological conditions. However, several tools for the analysis of such complex datasets are powerful, but hard-to-use with steep learning curves. In addition, some other tools are easy to use, but are weak in terms of analytical power. Previously, we have introduced ProteoSign, a powerful, yet user-friendly open-source online platform for protein differential expression/abundance analysis designed with the end-proteomics user in mind. Part of Proteosign's power stems from the utilization of the well-established Linear Models For Microarray Data (LIMMA) methodology. Here, we present a substantial upgrade of this computational resource, called ProteoSign v2, where we introduce major improvements, also based on user feedback. The new version offers more plot options, supports additional experimental designs, analyzes updated input datasets and performs a gene enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed proteins. We also introduce the deployment of the Docker technology and significantly increase the speed of a full analysis. ProteoSign v2 is available at http://bioinformatics.med.uoc.gr/ProteoSign.",http://bioinformatics.med.uoc.gr/ProteoSign.
33772584,Bioconductor toolchain for reproducible bioinformatics pipelines using Rcwl and RcwlPipelines.,"<h4>Summary</h4>The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is used to provide portable and reproducible data analysis workflows across different tools and computing environments. We have developed Rcwl, an R interface to CWL, to provide easier development, use, and maintenance of CWL pipelines from within R. We have also collected more than 100 pre-built tools and pipelines in RcwlPipelines, ready to be queried and used by researchers in their own analysis. A single-cell RNA sequencing preprocessing pipeline demonstrates use of the software.<h4>Availability</h4>Project website: https://rcwl.org (Rcwl: https://bioconductor.org/packages/Rcwl; RcwlPipelines: https://bioconductor.org/packages/RcwlPipelines).<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",https://rcwl.org
34015821,ProtCHOIR: a tool for proteome-scale generation of homo-oligomers.,"The rapid developments in gene sequencing technologies achieved in the recent decades, along with the expansion of knowledge on the three-dimensional structures of proteins, have enabled the construction of proteome-scale databases of protein models such as the Genome3D and ModBase. Nevertheless, although gene products are usually expressed as individual polypeptide chains, most biological processes are associated with either transient or stable oligomerisation. In the PDB databank, for example, ~40% of the deposited structures contain at least one homo-oligomeric interface. Unfortunately, databases of protein models are generally devoid of multimeric structures. To tackle this particular issue, we have developed ProtCHOIR, a tool that is able to generate homo-oligomeric structures in an automated fashion, providing detailed information for the input protein and output complex. ProtCHOIR requires input of either a sequence or a protomeric structure that is queried against a pre-constructed local database of homo-oligomeric structures, then extensively analyzed using well-established tools such as PSI-Blast, MAFFT, PISA and Molprobity. Finally, MODELLER is employed to achieve the construction of the homo-oligomers. The output complex is thoroughly analyzed taking into account its stereochemical quality, interfacial stabilities, hydrophobicity and conservation profile. All these data are then summarized in a user-friendly HTML report that can be saved or printed as a PDF file. The software is easily parallelizable and also outputs a comma-separated file with summary statistics that can straightforwardly be concatenated as a spreadsheet-like document for large-scale data analyses. As a proof-of-concept, we built oligomeric models for the Mabellini Mycobacterium abscessus structural proteome database. ProtCHOIR can be run as a web-service and the code can be obtained free-of-charge at http://lmdm.biof.ufrj.br/protchoir.",http://lmdm.biof.ufrj.br/protchoir.

31372596,Accelerating structure-function mapping using the ViVa webtool to mine natural variation.,"Thousands of sequenced genomes are now publicly available capturing a significant amount of natural variation within plant species; yet, much of these data remain inaccessible to researchers without significant bioinformatics experience. Here, we present a webtool called ViVa (Visualizing Variation) which aims to empower any researcher to take advantage of the amazing genetic resource collected in the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> 1001 Genomes Project (http://1001genomes.org). ViVa facilitates data mining on the gene, gene family, or gene network level. To test the utility and accessibility of ViVa, we assembled a team with a range of expertise within biology and bioinformatics to analyze the natural variation within the well-studied nuclear auxin signaling pathway. Our analysis has provided further confirmation of existing knowledge and has also helped generate new hypotheses regarding this well-studied pathway. These results highlight how natural variation could be used to generate and test hypotheses about less-studied gene families and networks, especially when paired with biochemical and genetic characterization. ViVa is also readily extensible to databases of interspecific genetic variation in plants as well as other organisms, such as the 3,000 Rice Genomes Project ( http://snp-seek.irri.org/) and human genetic variation ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/).",http://1001genomes.org).
33772596,FUNGI: Fusion Gene Integration Toolset.,<h4>Motivation</h4>Fusion genes are both useful cancer biomarkers and important drug targets. Finding relevant fusion genes is challenging due to genomic instability resulting in a high number of passenger events. To reveal and prioritize relevant gene fusion events we have developed FUNGI (FUsionN Gene Identification toolset) that uses an ensemble of fusion detection algorithms with prioritization and visualization modules.<h4>Results</h4>We applied FUNGI to an ovarian cancer dataset of 107 tumor samples from 36 patients. Ten out of 11 detected and prioritized fusion genes were validated. Many of detected fusion genes affect the PI3K-AKT pathway with potential role in treatment resistance.<h4>Availability</h4>FUNGI and its documentation are available at https://bitbucket.org/alejandra_cervera/fungi as standalone or from Anduril at https://www.anduril.org.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.,https://bitbucket.org/alejandra_cervera/fungi
34038028,Using the PhenX Toolkit to Select Standard Measurement Protocols for Your Research Study.,"The goals of PhenX (consensus measures for Phenotypes and eXposures) are to promote the use of standard measurement protocols and to help investigators identify opportunities for collaborative research and cross-study analysis, thus increasing the impact of individual studies. The PhenX Toolkit (https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/) offers high-quality, well-established measurement protocols to assess phenotypes and exposures in studies with human participants. The Toolkit contains protocols representing 29 research domains and 6 specialty collections of protocols that add depth to the Toolkit in specific research areas (e.g., COVID-19, Social Determinants of Health [SDoH], Blood Sciences Research [BSR], Mental Health Research [MHR], Tobacco Regulatory Research [TRR], and Substance Abuse and Addiction [SAA]). Protocols are recommended for inclusion in the PhenX Toolkit by Working Groups of domain experts using a consensus process that includes input from the scientific community. For each PhenX protocol, the Toolkit provides a detailed description, the rationale for inclusion, and supporting documentation. Users can browse protocols in the Toolkit, search the Toolkit using keywords, or use Browse Protocols Tree to identify protocols of interest. The PhenX Toolkit provides data dictionaries compatible with the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP), Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) data submission compatibility, and data collection worksheets to help investigators incorporate PhenX protocols into their study design.

33959747,Updates to HCOP: the HGNC comparison of orthology predictions tool.,"Multiple resources currently exist that predict orthologous relationships between genes. These resources differ both in the methodologies used and in the species they make predictions for. The HGNC Comparison of Orthology Predictions (HCOP) search tool integrates and displays data from multiple ortholog prediction resources for a specified human gene or set of genes. An indication of the reliability of a prediction is provided by the number of resources that support it. HCOP was originally designed to show orthology predictions between human and mouse but has been expanded to include data from a current total of 20 selected vertebrate and model organism species. The HCOP pipeline used to fetch and integrate the information from the disparate ortholog and nomenclature data resources has recently been rewritten, both to enable the inclusion of new data and to take advantage of modern web technologies. Data from HCOP are used extensively in our work naming genes as the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (https://vertebrate.genenames.org).",https://vertebrate.genenames.org).
31444973,CLASTR: The Cellosaurus STR similarity search tool - A precious help for cell line authentication.,"Despite an increased awareness of the problematic of cell line cross-contamination and misidentification, it remains nowadays a major source of erroneous experimental results in biomedical research. To prevent it, researchers are expected to frequently test the authenticity of the cell lines they are working on. STR profiling was selected as the international reference method to perform cell line authentication. While the experimental protocols and manipulations for generating a STR profile are well described, the available tools and workflows to analyze such data are lacking. The Cellosaurus knowledge resource aimed to improve the situation by compiling all the publicly available STR profiles from the literature and other databases. As a result, it grew to become the largest database in terms of human STR profiles, with 6,474 distinct cell lines having an associated STR profile (release July 31, 2019). Here we present CLASTR, the Cellosaurus STR similarity search tool enabling users to compare one or more STR profiles with those available in the Cellosaurus cell line knowledge resource. It aims to help researchers in the process of cell line authentication by providing numerous functionalities. The tool is publicly accessible on the SIB ExPASy server (https://web.expasy.org/cellosaurus-str-search) and its source code is available on GitHub under the GPL-3.0 license.",https://web.expasy.org/cellosaurus-str-search)
33784373,Bioinformatics tools developed to support BioCompute Objects.,"Developments in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) result in an exponential increase in the amount of data generated by sequencing experiments, an increase in the complexity of bioinformatics analysis reporting and an increase in the types of data generated. These increases in volume, diversity and complexity of the data generated and their analysis expose the necessity of a structured and standardized reporting template. BioCompute Objects (BCOs) provide the requisite support for communication of HTS data analysis that includes support for workflow, as well as data, curation, accessibility and reproducibility of communication. BCOs standardize how researchers report provenance and the established verification and validation protocols used in workflows while also being robust enough to convey content integration or curation in knowledge bases. BCOs that encapsulate tools, platforms, datasets and workflows are FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) compliant. Providing operational workflow and data information facilitates interoperability between platforms and incorporation of future dataset within an HTS analysis for use within industrial, academic and regulatory settings. Cloud-based platforms, including High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE), Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC) and Galaxy, support BCO generation for users. Given the 100K+ userbase between these platforms, BioCompute can be leveraged for workflow documentation. In this paper, we report the availability of platform-dependent and platform-independent BCO tools: HIVE BCO App, CGC BCO App, Galaxy BCO API Extension and BCO Portal. Community engagement was utilized to evaluate tool efficacy. We demonstrate that these tools further advance BCO creation from text editing approaches used in earlier releases of the standard. Moreover, we demonstrate that integrating BCO generation within existing analysis platforms greatly streamlines BCO creation while capturing granular workflow details. We also demonstrate that the BCO tools described in the paper provide an approach to solve the long-standing challenge of standardizing workflow descriptions that are both human and machine readable while accommodating manual and automated curation with evidence tagging.

32621232,Dockground Tool for Development and Benchmarking of Protein Docking Procedures.,"Databases of protein-protein complexes are essential for the development of protein modeling/docking techniques. Such databases provide a knowledge base for docking algorithms, intermolecular potentials, search procedures, scoring functions, and refinement protocols. Development of docking techniques requires systematic validation of the modeling protocols on carefully curated benchmark sets of complexes. We present a description and a guide to the DOCKGROUND resource ( http://dockground.compbio.ku.edu ) for structural modeling of protein interactions. The resource integrates various datasets of protein complexes and other data for the development and testing of protein docking techniques. The sets include bound complexes, experimentally determined unbound, simulated unbound, model-model complexes, and docking decoys. The datasets are available to the user community through a Web interface.",http://dockground.compbio.ku.edu
33568057,GalaxyTrakr: a distributed analysis tool for public health whole genome sequence data accessible to non-bioinformaticians.,"<h4>Background</h4>Processing and analyzing whole genome sequencing (WGS) is computationally intense: a single Illumina MiSeq WGS run produces‚Äâ~‚Äâ1 million 250-base-pair reads for each of 24 samples. This poses significant obstacles for smaller laboratories, or laboratories not affiliated with larger projects, which may not have dedicated bioinformatics staff or computing power to effectively use genomic data to protect public health. Building on the success of the cloud-based Galaxy bioinformatics platform ( http://galaxyproject.org ), already known for its user-friendliness and powerful WGS analytical tools, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) created a customized 'instance' of the Galaxy environment, called GalaxyTrakr ( https://www.galaxytrakr.org ), for use by laboratory scientists performing food-safety regulatory research. The goal was to enable laboratories outside of the FDA internal network to (1) perform quality assessments of sequence data, (2) identify links between clinical isolates and positive food/environmental samples, including those at the National Center for Biotechnology Information sequence read archive ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/ ), and (3) explore new methodologies such as metagenomics. GalaxyTrakr hosts a variety of free and adaptable tools and provides the data storage and computing power to run the tools. These tools support coordinated analytic methods and consistent interpretation of results across laboratories. Users can create and share tools for their specific needs and use sequence data generated locally and elsewhere.<h4>Results</h4>In its first full year (2018), GalaxyTrakr processed over 85,000 jobs and went from 25 to 250 users, representing 53 different public and state health laboratories, academic institutions, international health laboratories, and federal organizations. By mid-2020, it has grown to 600 registered users and processed over 450,000 analytical jobs. To illustrate how laboratories are making use of this resource, we describe how six institutions use GalaxyTrakr to quickly analyze and review their data. Instructions for participating in GalaxyTrakr are provided.<h4>Conclusions</h4>GalaxyTrakr advances food safety by providing reliable and harmonized WGS analyses for public health laboratories and promoting collaboration across laboratories with differing resources. Anticipated enhancements to this resource will include workflows for additional foodborne pathogens, viruses, and parasites, as well as new tools and services.",http://galaxyproject.org
33083503,The babyPose dataset.,"The database here described contains data relevant to preterm infants' movement acquired in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The data consists of 16 depth videos recorded during the actual clinical practice. Each video consists of 1000 frames (i.e., 100s). The dataset was acquired at the NICU of the Salesi Hospital, Ancona (Italy). Each frame was annotated with the limb-joint location. Twelve joints were annotated, i.e., left and right shoul- der, elbow, wrist, hip, knee and ankle. The database is freely accessible at http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3891404. This dataset represents a unique resource for artificial intelligence researchers that want to develop algorithms to provide healthcare professionals working in NICUs with decision support. Hence, the babyPose dataset is the first annotated dataset of depth images relevant to preterm infants' movement analysis.",http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3891404.

We obtained data from a Google search of web pages of local and national commercial and public broadcasters and newspapers, and of the orders themselves.  In the database, we present data identifying the county, municipality or tribal council, date of the order, and the source's internet address. In the 34 states with statewide orders, local governments in 21 of these states issued mandates in 218 municipalities, 155 counties, and 1 tribal council.

33087719,Density functional theory-based electric field gradient database.,"The deviation of the electron density around the nuclei from spherical symmetry determines the electric field gradient (EFG), which can be measured by various types of spectroscopy. Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR) is particularly sensitive to the EFG. The EFGs, and by implication NQR frequencies, vary dramatically across materials. Consequently, searching for NQR spectral lines in previously uninvestigated materials represents a major challenge. Calculated EFGs can significantly aid at the search's inception. To facilitate this task, we have applied high-throughput density functional theory calculations to predict EFGs for 15187 materials in the JARVIS-DFT database. This database, which will include EFG as a standard entry, is continuously increasing. Given the large scope of the database, it is impractical to verify each calculation. However, we assess accuracy by singling out cases for which reliable experimental information is readily available and compare them to the calculations. We further present a statistical analysis of the results. The database and tools associated with our work are made publicly available by JARVIS-DFT ( https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/~knc6/JVASP.html ) and NIST-JARVIS API ( http://jarvis.nist.gov/ ).",https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/
34048547,emiRIT: a text-mining-based resource for microRNA information.,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are essential gene regulators, and their dysregulation often leads to diseases. Easy access to miRNA information is crucial for interpreting generated experimental data, connecting facts across publications and developing new hypotheses built on previous knowledge. Here, we present extracting miRNA Information from Text (emiRIT), a text-miningbased resource, which presents miRNA information mined from the literature through a user-friendly interface. We collected 149‚Äâ,233 miRNA -PubMed ID pairs from Medline between January 1997 and May 2020. emiRIT currently contains 'miRNA -gene regulation' (69‚Äâ,152 relations), 'miRNA disease (cancer)' (12‚Äâ,300 relations), 'miRNA -biological process and pathways' (23, 390 relations) and circulatory 'miRNAs in extracellular locations' (3782 relations). Biological entities and their relation to miRNAs were extracted from Medline abstracts using publicly available and in-house developed text-mining tools, and the entities were normalized to facilitate querying and integration. We built a database and an interface to store and access the integrated data, respectively. We provide an up-to-date and user-friendly resource to facilitate access to comprehensive miRNA information from the literature on a large scale, enabling users to navigate through different roles of miRNA and examine them in a context specific to their information needs. To assess our resource's information coverage, we have conducted two case studies focusing on the target and differential expression information of miRNAs in the context of cancer and a third case study to assess the usage of emiRIT in the curation of miRNA information.
