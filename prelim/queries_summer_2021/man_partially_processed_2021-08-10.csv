"34179956","The DNA methylation haplotype (mHap) format and mHapTools.","<h4>Summary</h4>Bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) is currently the gold standard for measuring genome-wide DNA methylation profiles at single-nucleotide resolution. Most analyses focus on mean CpG methylation and ignore methylation states on the same DNA fragments [DNA methylation haplotypes (mHaps)]. Here, we propose mHap, a simple DNA mHap format for storing DNA BS-seq data. This format reduces the size of a BAM file by 40- to 140-fold while retaining complete read-level CpG methylation information. It is also compatible with the Tabix tool for fast and random access. We implemented a command-line tool, mHapTools, for converting BAM/SAM files from existing platforms to mHap files as well as post-processing DNA methylation data in mHap format. With this tool, we processed all publicly available human reduced representation bisulfite sequencing data and provided these data as a comprehensive mHap database.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://jiantaoshi.github.io/mHap/index.html.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","https://jiantaoshi.github.io/mHap/index.html.<h4>Supplementary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""jiantaoshi"", ""github"", ""io"", ""mhap"", ""index"", ""html"", ""h4"", ""supplementary"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""dna"", ""methylation"", ""haplotype"", ""mhap"", ""mat"", """", ""mhaps"")","c(""<h4>summary<"", ""h4>bisulfite"", ""sequencing"", ""bs"", ""seq"", ""is"", ""currently"", """", ""gold"", ""stard"", """", ""measuring"", ""genome"", ""wide"", ""dna"", ""methylation"", ""profiles"", ""at"", ""single"", ""nucleotide"", ""resolution"", """", ""analyses"", ""focus"", ""on"", ""mean"", ""cpg"", """", ""ignore"", ""states"", ""same"", ""fragments"", ""haplotypes"", ""mhaps"", """", ""we"", ""propose"", ""mhap"", ""a"", ""simple"", ""mat"", ""storing"", """", """", ""reduces"", ""size"", ""of"", ""bam"", ""file"", ""by"", ""40"", ""to"", ""140"", ""fold"",

"33963869","ProteoSign v2: a faster and evolved user-friendly online tool for statistical analyses of differential proteomics.","Bottom-up proteomics analyses have been proved over the last years to be a powerful tool in the characterization of the proteome and are crucial for understanding cellular and organism behaviour. Through differential proteomic analysis researchers can shed light on groups of proteins or individual proteins that play key roles in certain, normal or pathological conditions. However, several tools for the analysis of such complex datasets are powerful, but hard-to-use with steep learning curves. In addition, some other tools are easy to use, but are weak in terms of analytical power. Previously, we have introduced ProteoSign, a powerful, yet user-friendly open-source online platform for protein differential expression/abundance analysis designed with the end-proteomics user in mind. Part of Proteosign's power stems from the utilization of the well-established Linear Models For Microarray Data (LIMMA) methodology. Here, we present a substantial upgrade of this computational resource, called ProteoSign v2, where we introduce major improvements, also based on user feedback. The new version offers more plot options, supports additional experimental designs, analyzes updated input datasets and performs a gene enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed proteins.

"34015821","ProtCHOIR: a tool for proteome-scale generation of homo-oligomers.","The rapid developments in gene sequencing technologies achieved in the recent decades, along with the expansion of knowledge on the three-dimensional structures of proteins, have enabled the construction of proteome-scale databases of protein models such as the Genome3D and ModBase. Nevertheless, although gene products are usually expressed as individual polypeptide chains, most biological processes are associated with either transient or stable oligomerisation. In the PDB databank, for example, ~40% of the deposited structures contain at least one homo-oligomeric interface. Unfortunately, databases of protein models are generally devoid of multimeric structures. To tackle this particular issue, we have developed ProtCHOIR, a tool that is able to generate homo-oligomeric structures in an automated fashion, providing detailed information for the input protein and output complex. ProtCHOIR requires input of either a sequence or a protomeric structure that is queried against a pre-constructed local database of homo-oligomeric structures, then extensively analyzed using well-established tools such as PSI-Blast, MAFFT, PISA and Molprobity. Finally, MODELLER is employed to achieve the construction of the homo-oligomers. The output complex is thoroughly analyzed taking into account its stereochemical quality, interfacial stabilities, hydrophobicity and conservation profile. All these data are then summarized in a user-friendly HTML report that can be saved or printed as a PDF file. The software is easily parallelizable and also outputs a comma-separated file with summary statistics that can straightforwardly be concatenated as a spreadsheet-like document for large-scale data analyses. As a proof-of-concept, we built oligomeric models for the Mabellini Mycobacterium abscessus structural proteome database.

"33784373","Bioinformatics tools developed to support BioCompute Objects.","Developments in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) result in an exponential increase in the amount of data generated by sequencing experiments, an increase in the complexity of bioinformatics analysis reporting and an increase in the types of data generated. These increases in volume, diversity and complexity of the data generated and their analysis expose the necessity of a structured and standardized reporting template. BioCompute Objects (BCOs) provide the requisite support for communication of HTS data analysis that includes support for workflow, as well as data, curation, accessibility and reproducibility of communication. BCOs standardize how researchers report provenance and the established verification and validation protocols used in workflows while also being robust enough to convey content integration or curation in knowledge bases. BCOs that encapsulate tools, platforms, datasets and workflows are FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) compliant. Providing operational workflow and data information facilitates interoperability between platforms and incorporation of future dataset within an HTS analysis for use within industrial, academic and regulatory settings. Cloud-based platforms, including High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE), Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC) and Galaxy, support BCO generation for users. Given the 100K+ userbase between these platforms, BioCompute can be leveraged for workflow documentation. In this paper, we report the availability of platform-dependent and platform-independent BCO tools: HIVE BCO App, CGC BCO App, Galaxy BCO API Extension and BCO Portal. Community engagement was utilized to evaluate tool efficacy. We demonstrate that these tools further advance BCO creation from text editing approaches used in earlier releases of the standard. Moreover, we demonstrate that integrating BCO generation within existing analysis platforms greatly streamlines BCO creation while capturing granular workflow details. We also demonstrate that the BCO tools described in the paper provide an approach to solve the long-standing challenge of standardizing workflow descriptions that are both human and machine readable while accommodating manual and automated curation with evidence tagging.

Here, we describe a novel machine learned <i>in silico</i> cytochrome P450 (CYP450) metabolism prediction suite, called CyProduct, that accurately predicts metabolic byproducts for a specified molecule and a human CYP450 isoform. It includes three modules: (1) CypReact, a tool that predicts if the query compound reacts with a given CYP450 enzyme, (2) CypBoM, a tool that accurately predicts the ""bond site"" of the reaction (i.e., which specific bonds within the query molecule react with the CYP isoform), and (3) MetaboGen, a tool that generates the metabolic byproducts based on CypBoM's bond-site prediction. CyProduct predicts metabolic biotransformation products for each of the nine most important human CYP450 enzymes. CypBoM uses an important new concept called ""bond of metabolism"" (BoM), which extends the traditional ""site of metabolism"" (SoM) by specifying the information about the set of chemical <i>bonds</i> that is modified or formed in a metabolic reaction (rather than the specific atom). We created a BoM database for 1845 CYP450-mediated Phase I reactions, then used this to train the CypBoM Predictor to predict the reactive bond locations on substrate molecules. CypBoM Predictor's cross-validated Jaccard score for reactive bond prediction ranged from 0.380 to 0.452 over the nine CYP450 enzymes. Over variants of a test set of 68 known CYP450 substrates and 30 nonreactants, CyProduct outperformed the other packages, including ADMET Predictor, BioTransformer, and GLORY, by an average of 200% (with respect to Jaccard score) in terms of predicting metabolites.

"32778891","MolAICal: a soft tool for 3D drug design of protein targets by artificial intelligence and classical algorithm.","Deep learning is an important branch of artificial intelligence that has been successfully applied into medicine and two-dimensional ligand design. The three-dimensional (3D) ligand generation in the 3D pocket of protein target is an interesting and challenging issue for drug design by deep learning. Here, the MolAICal software is introduced to supply a way for generating 3D drugs in the 3D pocket of protein targets by combining with merits of deep learning model and classical algorithm. The MolAICal software mainly contains two modules for 3D drug design. In the first module of MolAICal, it employs the genetic algorithm, deep learning model trained by FDA-approved drug fragments and Vinardo score fitting on the basis of PDBbind database for drug design. In the second module, it uses deep learning generative model trained by drug-like molecules of ZINC database and molecular docking invoked by Autodock Vina automatically. Besides, the Lipinski's rule of five, Pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS), synthetic accessibility (SA) and other user-defined rules are introduced for filtering out unwanted ligands in MolAICal. To show the drug design modules of MolAICal, the membrane protein glucagon receptor and non-membrane protein SARS-CoV-2 main protease are chosen as the investigative drug targets.

"32810207","MELODI Presto: a fast and agile tool to explore semantic triples derived from biomedical literature.","<h4>Summary</h4>The field of literature-based discovery is growing in step with the volume of literature being produced. From modern natural language processing algorithms to high quality entity tagging, the methods and their impact are developing rapidly. One annotation object that arises from these approaches, the subject-predicate-object triple, is proving to be very useful in representing knowledge. We have implemented efficient search methods and an application programming interface, to create fast and convenient functions to utilize triples extracted from the biomedical literature by SemMedDB. By refining these data, we have identified a set of triples that focus on the mechanistic aspects of the literature, and provide simple methods to explore both enriched triples from single queries, and overlapping triples across two query lists.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://melodi-presto.mrcieu.ac.uk/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","https://melodi-presto.mrcieu.ac.uk/.<h4>Supplementary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""melodi"", ""presto"", ""mrcieu"", ""ac"", ""uk"", ""h4"", ""supplementary"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""melodi"", ""presto"", ""a"", ""fast"", """", ""agile"", """", ""to"", ""explore"", ""semantic"", ""triples"", ""derived"", """", ""biomedical"", ""literature"")","c(""<h4>summary<"", ""h4>"", ""field"", ""of"", ""literature"", ""based"", ""discy"", ""is"", ""growing"", ""in"", ""step"", """", """", ""volume"", ""being"", ""produced"", """", ""modern"", ""natural"", ""language"", ""processing"", ""algorithms"", ""to"", """", ""quality"", ""entity"", ""tagging"", ""methods"", """", ""ir"", ""impact"", """", ""developing"", ""rapidly"", """", ""anation"", ""object"", """", ""arises"", ""se"", ""approaches"", ""subject"", ""predicate"", ""triple"", ""proving"", ""be"", ""very"", ""ful"", ""representing"", ""knowledge"",

"33067342","OpenPepXL: An Open-Source Tool for Sensitive Identification of Cross-Linked Peptides in XL-MS.","Cross-linking MS (XL-MS) has been recognized as an effective source of information about protein structures and interactions. In contrast to regular peptide identification, XL-MS has to deal with a quadratic search space, where peptides from every protein could potentially be cross-linked to any other protein. To cope with this search space, most tools apply different heuristics for search space reduction. We introduce a new open-source XL-MS database search algorithm, OpenPepXL, which offers increased sensitivity compared with other tools. OpenPepXL searches the full search space of an XL-MS experiment without using heuristics to reduce it. Because of efficient data structures and built-in parallelization OpenPepXL achieves excellent runtimes and can also be deployed on large compute clusters and cloud services while maintaining a slim memory footprint. We compared OpenPepXL to several other commonly used tools for identification of noncleavable labeled and label-free cross-linkers on a diverse set of XL-MS experiments. In our first comparison, we used a data set from a fraction of a cell lysate with a protein database of 128 targets and 128 decoys. At 5% FDR, OpenPepXL finds from 7% to over 50% more unique residue pairs (URPs) than other tools. On data sets with available high-resolution structures for cross-link validation OpenPepXL reports from 7% to over 40% more structurally validated URPs than other tools. Additionally, we used a synthetic peptide data set that allows objective validation of cross-links without relying on structural information and found that OpenPepXL reports at least 12% more validated URPs than other tools. It has been built as part of the OpenMS suite of tools and supports Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. OpenPepXL also supports the MzIdentML 1.2 format for XL-MS identification results.

"34058399","BA-plotteR - A web tool for generating Bland-Altman plots and constructing limits of agreement.","Investigators use Bland-Altman plot (Limits of Agreement plot) to compare two methods measuring the same continuous variable to determine interchangeability or agreement of the methods. The method has evolved to deal with heteroscedastic data and fixed or proportional biases (or both). Although an ordinary Bland-Altman plot can be readily made with various software applications, there is no free, open-source application that is dedicated to producing Bland-Altman plots and constructing limits of agreement for data that do not meet the assumptions of a simple comparison. To fill this gap, we created BA-plotteR, a web-based, open-source, freeware tool created in Shiny/R that is dedicated to creating Bland-Altman plots. We validated the tool using 20 datasets with various data distributions by comparing the output from the tool against manually derived results. The webtool handles data that requires a more complex analysis than is commonly available through commercial statistical programs. Moreover, the automated analysis of the data distribution will guide users and help them to correctly plot and analyse their data. The tool agreed perfectly with manually constructed plots.

"33009809","Detection of mobile genetic elements associated with antibiotic resistance in Salmonella enterica using a newly developed web tool: MobileElementFinder.","<h4>Objectives</h4>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in clinically relevant bacteria is a growing threat to public health globally. In these bacteria, antimicrobial resistance genes are often associated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which promote their mobility, enabling them to rapidly spread throughout a bacterial community.<h4>Methods</h4>The tool MobileElementFinder was developed to enable rapid detection of MGEs and their genetic context in assembled sequence data. MGEs are detected based on sequence similarity to a database of 4452 known elements augmented with annotation of resistance genes, virulence factors and detection of plasmids.<h4>Results</h4>MobileElementFinder was applied to analyse the mobilome of 1725 sequenced Salmonella enterica isolates of animal origin from Denmark, Germany and the USA. We found that the MGEs were seemingly conserved according to multilocus ST and not restricted to either the host or the country of origin. Moreover, we identified putative translocatable units for specific aminoglycoside, sulphonamide and tetracycline genes. Several putative composite transposons were predicted that could mobilize, among others, AMR, metal resistance and phosphodiesterase genes associated with macrophage survivability. This is, to our knowledge, the first time the phosphodiesterase-like pdeL has been found to be potentially mobilized into S. enterica.<h4>Conclusions</h4>MobileElementFinder is a powerful tool to study the epidemiology of MGEs in a large number of genome sequences and to determine the potential for genomic plasticity of bacteria.

"33956141","CeLaVi: an interactive cell lineage visualization tool.","Recent innovations in genetics and imaging are providing the means to reconstruct cell lineages, either by tracking cell divisions using live microscopy, or by deducing the history of cells using molecular recorders. A cell lineage on its own, however, is simply a description of cell divisions as branching events. A major goal of current research is to integrate this description of cell relationships with information about the spatial distribution and identities of the cells those divisions produce. Visualizing, interpreting and exploring these complex data in an intuitive manner requires the development of new tools. Here we present CeLaVi, a web-based visualization tool that allows users to navigate and interact with a representation of cell lineages, whilst simultaneously visualizing the spatial distribution, identities and properties of cells. CeLaVi's principal functions include the ability to explore and manipulate the cell lineage tree; to visualise the spatial distribution of cell clones at different depths of the tree; to colour cells in the 3D viewer based on lineage relationships; to visualise various cell qualities on the 3D viewer (e.g. gene expression, cell type) and to annotate selected cells/clones.

"31501868","Diurnal.plant.tools: Comparative Transcriptomic and Co-expression Analyses of Diurnal Gene Expression of the Archaeplastida Kingdom.","Almost all organisms coordinate some aspects of their biology through the diurnal cycle. Photosynthetic organisms, and plants especially, have established complex programs that coordinate physiological, metabolic and developmental processes with the changing light. The diurnal regulation of the underlying transcriptional processes is observed when groups of functionally related genes (gene modules) are expressed at a specific time of the day. However, studying the diurnal regulation of these gene modules in the plant kingdom was hampered by the large amount of data required for the analyses. To meet this need, we used gene expression data from 17 diurnal studies spanning the whole Archaeplastida kingdom (Plantae kingdom in the broad sense) to make an online diurnal database. We have equipped the database with tools that allow user-friendly cross-species comparisons of gene expression profiles, entire co-expression networks, co-expressed clusters (involved in specific biological processes), time-specific gene expression and others. We exemplify how these tools can be used by studying three important biological questions: (i) the evolution of cell division, (ii) the diurnal control of gene modules in algae and (iii) the conservation of diurnally controlled modules across species.

"34000199","A Deep Learning Enhanced Novel Software Tool for Laryngeal Dynamics Analysis.","Purpose High-speed videoendoscopy (HSV) is an emerging, but barely used, endoscopy technique in the clinic to assess and diagnose voice disorders because of the lack of dedicated software to analyze the data. HSV allows to quantify the vocal fold oscillations by segmenting the glottal area. This challenging task has been tackled by various studies; however, the proposed approaches are mostly limited and not suitable for daily clinical routine. Method We developed a user-friendly software in C# that allows the editing, motion correction, segmentation, and quantitative analysis of HSV data. We further provide pretrained deep neural networks for fully automatic glottis segmentation. Results We freely provide our software Glottis Analysis Tools (GAT). Using GAT, we provide a general threshold-based region growing platform that enables the user to analyze data from various sources, such as in vivo recordings, ex vivo recordings, and high-speed footage of artificial vocal folds. Additionally, especially for in vivo recordings, we provide three robust neural networks at various speed and quality settings to allow a fully automatic glottis segmentation needed for application by untrained personnel. GAT further evaluates video and audio data in parallel and is able to extract various features from the video data, among others the glottal area waveform, that is, the changing glottal area over time. In total, GAT provides 79 unique quantitative analysis parameters for video- and audio-based signals. Many of these parameters have already been shown to reflect voice disorders, highlighting the clinical importance and usefulness of the GAT software. Conclusion GAT is a unique tool to process HSV and audio data to determine quantitative, clinically relevant parameters for research, diagnosis, and treatment of laryngeal disorders.

"33630831","A plasmid DNA-launched SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics system and coronavirus toolkit for COVID-19 research.","The recent emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the underlying cause of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has led to a worldwide pandemic causing substantial morbidity, mortality, and economic devastation. In response, many laboratories have redirected attention to SARS-CoV-2, meaning there is an urgent need for tools that can be used in laboratories unaccustomed to working with coronaviruses. Here we report a range of tools for SARS-CoV-2 research. First, we describe a facile single plasmid SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics system that is simple to genetically manipulate and can be used to rescue infectious virus through transient transfection (without in vitro transcription or additional expression plasmids). The rescue system is accompanied by our panel of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (against nearly every viral protein), SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates, and SARS-CoV-2 permissive cell lines, which are all openly available to the scientific community.

"34147079","ORFik: a comprehensive R toolkit for the analysis of translation.","<h4>Background</h4>With the rapid growth in the use of high-throughput methods for characterizing translation and the continued expansion of multi-omics, there is a need for back-end functions and streamlined tools for processing, analyzing, and characterizing data produced by these assays.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we introduce ORFik, a user-friendly R/Bioconductor API and toolbox for studying translation and its regulation. It extends GenomicRanges from the genome to the transcriptome and implements a framework that integrates data from several sources. ORFik streamlines the steps to process, analyze, and visualize the different steps of translation with a particular focus on initiation and elongation. It accepts high-throughput sequencing data from ribosome profiling to quantify ribosome elongation or RCP-seq/TCP-seq to also quantify ribosome scanning. In addition, ORFik can use CAGE data to accurately determine 5'UTRs and RNA-seq for determining translation relative to RNA abundance. ORFik supports and calculates over 30 different translation-related features and metrics from the literature and can annotate translated regions such as proteins or upstream open reading frames (uORFs). As a use-case, we demonstrate using ORFik to rapidly annotate the dynamics of 5' UTRs across different tissues, detect their uORFs, and characterize their scanning and translation in the downstream protein-coding regions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In summary, ORFik introduces hundreds of tested, documented and optimized methods. ORFik is designed to be easily customizable, enabling users to create complete workflows from raw data to publication-ready figures for several types of sequencing data. Finally, by improving speed and scope of many core Bioconductor functions, ORFik offers enhancement benefiting the entire Bioconductor environment.<h4>Availability</h4>http://bioconductor.org/packages/ORFik .","http://bioconductor.org/packages/ORFik",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""bioconductor"", """", ""packages"", ""orfik"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""orfik"", ""a"", ""prehensive"", ""r"", ""kit"", """", """", ""analysis"", ""of"", ""translation"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>"", """", ""rapid"", ""growth"", ""in"", """", ""of"", """", ""throughput"", ""methods"", """", ""characterizing"", ""translation"", """", ""continued"", ""expansion"", ""multi"", ""omics"", ""re"", ""is"", ""a"", ""need"", ""back"", ""end"", ""functions"", ""streamlined"", ""s"", ""processing"", ""analyzing"", """", ""produced"", ""by"", ""se"", ""assays"", ""<h4>results<"", ""h4>"", ""we"", ""introduce"", ""orfik"", """", ""friendly"", ""r"", ""bioconductor"", ""api"", ""box"", ""studying"", """", ""regulation"", ""it"",

"33054771","smORFunction: a tool for predicting functions of small open reading frames and microproteins.","<h4>Background</h4>Small open reading frame (smORF) is open reading frame with a length of less than 100 codons. Microproteins, translated from smORFs, have been found to participate in a variety of biological processes such as muscle formation and contraction, cell proliferation, and immune activation. Although previous studies have collected and annotated a large abundance of smORFs, functions of the vast majority of smORFs are still unknown. It is thus increasingly important to develop computational methods to annotate the functions of these smORFs.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we collected 617,462 unique smORFs from three studies. The expression of smORF RNAs was estimated by reannotated microarray probes. Using a speed-optimized correlation algorism, the functions of smORFs were predicted by their correlated genes with known functional annotations. After applying our method to 5 known microproteins from literatures, our method successfully predicted their functions. Further validation from the UniProt database showed that at least one function of 202 out of 270 microproteins was predicted.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We developed a method, smORFunction, to provide function predictions of smORFs/microproteins in at most 265 models generated from 173 datasets, including 48 tissues/cells, 82 diseases (and normal).

Veterinary species are well studied, particularly livestock, to reduce their disease burden.

A prerequisite for any model selection is having the right quality and range of species-specific immunological reagents. To help promote the widest possible use of veterinary species, an open access website (https://www.immunologicaltoolbox.co.uk) has been created as a central community annotated hub for veterinary immunological reagents. The website is also the portal into services offered by the UK Immunological Toolbox project that includes antibody generation, sequencing and recombinant expression. The funding for this effort is linked into sustainable sources, but ultimate success relies on community engagement to continually increase the quality and quantity of information.

Here, we release a working version of TbCAPs, a new toolbox for CAP analysis, which includes all steps of the analytical pipeline, introduces new methodological developments that build on already existing concepts, and enables a facilitated inspection of CAPs and resulting metrics of brain dynamics. The toolbox is available on a public academic repository at https://c4science.ch/source/CAP_Toolbox.git. In addition, to illustrate the feasibility and usefulness of our pipeline, we describe an application to the study of human cognition.

The main long-term health concerns are neurodevelopmental disorders, carcinogenicity as well as endocrine disruption possibly leading to reproductive and metabolic disorders. Adverse outcome pathways (AOP) consist in linear representations of mechanistic perturbations at different levels of the biological organization. Although AOPs are chemical-agnostic, they can provide a better understanding of the Mode of Action of pesticides and can support a rational identification of effect markers.<h4>Results</h4>With the increasing amount of scientific literature and the development of biological databases, investigation of putative links between pesticides, from various chemical groups and AOPs using the biological events present in the AOP-Wiki database is now feasible. To identify co-occurrence between a specific pesticide and a biological event in scientific abstracts from the PubMed database, we used an updated version of the artificial intelligence-based AOP-helpFinder tool. This allowed us to decipher multiple links between the studied substances and molecular initiating events, key events and adverse outcomes.

"34153027","pyTFM: A tool for traction force and monolayer stress microscopy.","Cellular force generation and force transmission are of fundamental importance for numerous biological processes and can be studied with the methods of Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) and Monolayer Stress Microscopy. Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy solve the inverse problem of reconstructing cell-matrix tractions and inter- and intra-cellular stresses from the measured cell force-induced deformations of an adhesive substrate with known elasticity. Although several laboratories have developed software for Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy computations, there is currently no software package available that allows non-expert users to perform a full evaluation of such experiments. Here we present pyTFM, a tool to perform Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy on cell patches and cell layers grown in a 2-dimensional environment. pyTFM was optimized for ease-of-use; it is open-source and well documented (hosted at https://pytfm.readthedocs.io/) including usage examples and explanations of the theoretical background. pyTFM can be used as a standalone Python package or as an add-on to the image annotation tool ClickPoints. In combination with the ClickPoints environment, pyTFM allows the user to set all necessary analysis parameters, select regions of interest, examine the input data and intermediary results, and calculate a wide range of parameters describing forces, stresses, and their distribution. In this work, we also thoroughly analyze the accuracy and performance of the Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy algorithms of pyTFM using synthetic and experimental data from epithelial cell patches.","https://pytfm.readthedocs.io/)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""pytfm"", ""readdocs"", ""io"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""pytfm"", ""a"", """", """", ""traction"", ""ce"", """", ""monolayer"", ""stress"", ""microscopy"")","c(""ular"", ""ce"", ""ration"", """", ""transmission"", """", ""of"", ""fundamental"", ""importance"", """", ""numerous"", ""biological"", ""processes"", """", ""be"", ""studied"", """", """", ""methods"", ""traction"", ""microscopy"", ""tfm"", ""monolayer"", ""stress"", ""solve"", ""inverse"", ""problem"", ""reconstructing"", """", ""matrix"", ""tractions"", ""inter"", ""intra"", ""stresses"", """", ""measured"", ""induced"", ""demations"", ""an"", ""adhesive"", ""substrate"", ""known"", ""elasticity"", ""although"", ""several"", ""laboratories"",

"30261835","Sequence homology in eukaryotes (SHOE): interactive visual tool for promoter analysis.","<h4>Background</h4>Microarray and DNA-sequencing based technologies continue to produce enormous amounts of data on gene expression. This data has great potential to illuminate our understanding of biology and medicine, but the data alone is of limited value without computational tools to allow human investigators to visualize and interpret it in the context of their problem of interest.<h4>Results</h4>We created a web server called SHOE that provides an interactive, visual presentation of the available evidence of transcriptional regulation and gene co-expression to facilitate its exploration and interpretation. SHOE predicts the likely transcription factor binding sites in orthologous promoters of humans, mice, and rats using the combined information of 1) transcription factor binding preferences (position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) libraries such as Transfac32, Jaspar, HOCOMOCO, ChIP-seq, SELEX, PBM, and iPS-reprogramming factor), 2) evolutionary conservation of putative binding sites in orthologous promoters, and 3) co-expression tendencies of gene pairs based on 1,714 normal human cells selected from the Gene Expression Omnibus Database.<h4>Conclusion</h4>SHOE enables users to explore potential interactions between transcription factors and target genes via multiple data views, discover transcription factor binding motifs on top of gene co-expression, and visualize genes as a network of gene and transcription factors on its native gadget GeneViz, the CellDesigner pathway analyzer, and the Reactome database to search the pathways involved. As we demonstrate here when using the CREB1 and Nf-Œ∫B datasets, SHOE can reliably identify experimentally verified interactions and predict plausible novel ones, yielding new biological insights into the gene regulatory mechanisms involved. SHOE comes with a manual describing how to run it on a local PC or via the Garuda platform ( www.garuda-alliance.org ), where it joins other popular gadgets such as the CellDesigner pathway analyzer and the Reactome database, as part of analysis workflows to meet the growing needs of molecular biologists and medical researchers.

"31829207","Genepanel.iobio - an easy to use web tool for generating disease- and phenotype-associated gene lists.","When ordering genetic testing or triaging candidate variants in exome and genome sequencing studies, it is critical to generate and test a comprehensive list of candidate genes that succinctly describe the complete and objective phenotypic features of disease. Significant efforts have been made to curate gene:disease associations both in academic research and commercial genetic testing laboratory settings. However, many of these valuable resources exist as islands and must be used independently, generating static, single-resource gene:disease association lists. Here we describe genepanel.iobio (https://genepanel.iobio.io) an easy to use, free and open-source web tool for generating disease- and phenotype-associated gene lists from multiple gene:disease association resources, including the NCBI Genetic Testing Registry (GTR), Phenolyzer, and the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). We demonstrate the utility of genepanel.iobio by applying it to complex, rare and undiagnosed disease cases that had reached a diagnostic conclusion. We find that genepanel.iobio is able to correctly prioritize the gene containing the diagnostic variant in roughly half of these challenging cases. Importantly, each component resource contributed diagnostic value, showing the benefits of this aggregate approach. We expect genepanel.iobio will improve the ease and diagnostic value of generating gene:disease association lists for genetic test ordering and whole genome or exome sequencing variant prioritization.","https://genepanel.iobio.io)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""panel"", ""iobio"", ""io"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""panel"", ""iobio"", ""an"", ""easy"", ""to"", """", """", """", """", ""rating"", ""disease"", """", ""pheype"", ""associated"", """", ""lists"")","c(""when"", ""ordering"", ""tic"", ""testing"", ""or"", ""triaging"", ""didate"", ""variants"", ""in"", ""exome"", """", ""genome"", ""sequencing"", ""studies"", ""it"", ""is"", ""critical"", ""to"", ""rate"", ""test"", ""a"", ""prehensive"", ""list"", ""of"", ""s"", """", ""succinctly"", ""describe"", """", ""plete"", ""objective"", ""pheypic"", ""features"", ""disease"", ""signifit"", ""efts"", """", """", ""made"", ""curate"", """", ""associations"", """", ""academic"", ""research"", ""mercial"", ""laboratory"", ""tings"", ""however"",

In this work, we present a much needed, efficient and user-friendly Genome to KEGG Orthology (G2KO) pipeline tool that facilitates efficient comparison of system wide metabolic networks of multiple organisms simultaneously. The optimized strategy primarily involves automatic retrieval of the KEGG Orthology (KO) identifiers of user defined organisms from the KEGG database followed by overlaying and visualization of the metabolic genes using the KEGG Mapper reconstruct pathway tool. We demonstrate the applicability of G2KO via two case studies in which we processed 24,314 genes across 15 organisms, mapped on to 530 reference pathways in KEGG, while focusing on pathways of interest. First, an in-silico designing of synthetic microbial consortia towards bioprocessing of cellulose to valuable products by comparing the cellulose degradation and fermentative pathways of microbes was undertaken. Second, we comprehensively compared the amino acid biosynthetic pathways of multiple microbes and demonstrated the potential of G2KO as an efficient tool for metabolic studies. We envisage the tool will find immensely useful to the metabolic engineers as well as systems biologists.

The package can detect both false deletions and false duplications. We evaluated CNVfilteR performance on callsets generated by 13 CNV calling tools on 3 whole-genome sequencing and 541 panel samples, showing a decrease of up to 44.8% in false positives and consistent F1-score increase.

"32997734","Fijiyama: a registration tool for 3D multimodal time-lapse imaging.","<h4>Summary</h4>The increasing interest of animal and plant research communities for biomedical 3D imaging devices results in the emergence of new topics. The anatomy, structure and function of tissues can be observed non-destructively in time-lapse multimodal imaging experiments by combining the outputs of imaging devices such as X-ray CT and MRI scans. However, living samples cannot remain in these devices for a long period. Manual positioning and natural growth of the living samples induce variations in the shape, position and orientation in the acquired images that require a preprocessing step of 3D registration prior to analyses. This registration step becomes more complex when combining observations from devices that highlight various tissue structures. Identifying image invariants over modalities is challenging and can result in intractable problems. Fijiyama, a Fiji plugin built upon biomedical registration algorithms, is aimed at non-specialists to facilitate automatic alignment of 3D images acquired either at successive times and/or with different imaging systems. Its versatility was assessed on four case studies combining multimodal and time series data, spanning from micro to macro scales.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Fijiyama is an open source software (GPL license) implemented in Java.

"32367143","Not just a research method: If used with caution, can job-exposure matrices be a useful tool in the practice of occupational medicine and public health?","The recent editorial by Dr Susan Peters ""Although a valuable method in occupational epidemiology, job-exposure matrices are no magic fix"" ably describes the strengths and limitations of job-exposure matrix (JEM) approaches in occupational epidemiology research (1). In addition to their use in research, we would like to add that JEM may also be of use in compensation and surveillance efforts in occupational health. JEM could assist the compensation process by supporting the assessment of relevant exposures related to specific health conditions (2). The potential usefulness of a JEM as a decision tool for compensation of work-related musculoskeletal disorders has been examined (3). Because occupational diseases are often under-recognized, another practical application is using a JEM to screen for occupational exposures as part of health surveillance. Use of JEM to screen for asbestos and wood dust exposure in the clinical setting has shown promising results (4-6). By summarizing multiple exposures at a job level (7), JEM may also assist policy-makers in setting priorities for hazards and controls at work, as well as occupational practitioners to target prevention efforts and direct the conduct of more precise exposure measures to particular jobs. Sharing JEM across different countries may be useful in providing estimates of exposures across larger populations to calculate global burden of disease related to occupational exposure. The JEMINI (JEM InterNatIonal) initiative was launched to explore the possibility of developing international JEM that could be used across countries (8). Beginning with physical (biomechanical) exposures, this open group has started homogenizing job coding systems and comparing some available JEM. Estimating differences in the level of exposure between countries will require much more work, without guaranteed success. As Peters mentioned, many limitations exist in the use of JEM. Users of JEM must consider the source of exposure data - expert assessments, data collected from individual workers, or environmental sampling. The coding of occupations is time consuming and can introduce error (9), and more testing of and comparison with automated job coding systems is needed (10). JEM reflect an ""average"" level of exposure within a job at the expense of individual variation. At population level, JEM can offer a useful estimate of exposures. If used at an individual level in a clinical or compensation setting, JEM cannot replace the professionals involved in exposure assessment but may help them focus their action more effectively on complex situations that require their expertise. In conclusion, these JEM developed for research might also be used as a public health tool, provided that their limitations are properly taken into account. References 1. Peters S.

"32421835","InterPred: a webtool to predict chemical autofluorescence and luminescence interference.","High-throughput screening (HTS) research programs for drug development or chemical hazard assessment are designed to screen thousands of molecules across hundreds of biological targets or pathways. Most HTS platforms use fluorescence and luminescence technologies, representing more than 70% of the assays in the US Tox21 research consortium. These technologies are subject to interferent signals largely explained by chemicals interacting with light spectrum. This phenomenon results in up to 5-10% of false positive results, depending on the chemical library used. Here, we present the InterPred webserver (version 1.0), a platform to predict such interference chemicals based on the first large-scale chemical screening effort to directly characterize chemical-assay interference, using assays in the Tox21 portfolio specifically designed to measure autofluorescence and luciferase inhibition. InterPred combines 17 quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models built using optimized machine learning techniques and allows users to predict the probability that a new chemical will interfere with different combinations of cellular and technology conditions.

"32931552","AFid: a tool for automated identification and exclusion of autofluorescent objects from microscopy images.","<h4>Motivation</h4>Autofluorescence is a long-standing problem that has hindered the analysis of images of tissues acquired by fluorescence microscopy. Current approaches to mitigate autofluorescence in tissue are lab-based and involve either chemical treatment of sections or specialized instrumentation and software to 'unmix' autofluorescent signals. Importantly, these approaches are pre-emptive and there are currently no methods to deal with autofluorescence in acquired fluorescence microscopy images.<h4>Results</h4>To address this, we developed Autofluorescence Identifier (AFid). AFid identifies autofluorescent pixels as discrete objects in multi-channel images post-acquisition. These objects can then be tagged for exclusion from downstream analysis. We validated AFid using images of FFPE human colorectal tissue stained for common immune markers. Further, we demonstrate its utility for image analysis where its implementation allows the accurate measurement of HIV-Dendritic cell interactions in a colorectal explant model of HIV transmission. Therefore, AFid represents a major leap forward in the extraction of useful data from images plagued by autofluorescence by offering an approach that is easily incorporated into existing workflows and that can be used with various samples, staining panels and image acquisition methods. We have implemented AFid in ImageJ, Matlab and R to accommodate the diverse image analysis community.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>AFid software is available at https://ellispatrick.github.io/AFid.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","https://ellispatrick.github.io/AFid.<h4>Supplementary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""ellispatrick"", ""github"", ""io"", ""afid"", ""h4"", ""supplementary"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""afid"", ""a"", """", """", ""automated"", ""identification"", """", ""exclusion"", ""of"", ""autofluorescent"", ""objects"", """", ""microscopy"", ""images"")","c(""<h4>motivation<"", ""h4>autofluorescence"", ""is"", ""a"", ""long"", ""sting"", ""problem"", """", """", ""hindered"", """", ""analysis"", ""of"", ""images"", ""tissues"", ""acquired"", ""by"", ""fluorescence"", ""microscopy"", ""current"", ""approaches"", ""to"", ""mitigate"", ""autofluorescence"", ""in"", ""tissue"", """", ""lab"", ""based"", """", ""involve"", ""eir"", ""chemical"", ""treatment"", ""sections"", ""or"", ""specialized"", ""instrumentation"", ""softw"", ""unmix"", ""autofluorescent"", ""signals"", ""importantly"", ""se"", ""pre"", ""emptive"",

"29539190","MSeqDR mvTool: A mitochondrial DNA Web and API resource for comprehensive variant annotation, universal nomenclature collation, and reference genome conversion.","Accurate mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variant annotation is essential for the clinical diagnosis of diverse human diseases. Substantial challenges to this process include the inconsistency in mtDNA nomenclatures, the existence of multiple reference genomes, and a lack of reference population frequency data. Clinicians need a simple bioinformatics tool that is user-friendly, and bioinformaticians need a powerful informatics resource for programmatic usage. Here, we report the development and functionality of the MSeqDR mtDNA Variant Tool set (mvTool), a one-stop mtDNA variant annotation and analysis Web service. mvTool is built upon the MSeqDR infrastructure (https://mseqdr.org), with contributions of expert curated data from MITOMAP (https://www.mitomap.org) and HmtDB (https://www.hmtdb.uniba.it/hmdb). mvTool supports all mtDNA nomenclatures, converts variants to standard rCRS- and HGVS-based nomenclatures, and annotates novel mtDNA variants. Besides generic annotations from dbNSFP and Variant Effect Predictor (VEP), mvTool provides allele frequencies in more than 47,000 germline mitogenomes, and disease and pathogenicity classifications from MSeqDR, Mitomap, HmtDB and ClinVar (Landrum et al., 2013). mvTools also provides mtDNA somatic variants annotations. ""mvTool API"" is implemented for programmatic access using inputs in VCF, HGVS, or classical mtDNA variant nomenclatures.

With population genomic data becoming available for an increasing number of model organisms, researchers are interested in manipulating multiple strains and lines. CRISpy-pop is a web application that generates and filters guide RNA sequences for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing for diverse yeast and bacterial strains. The current implementation designs and predicts the activity of guide RNAs against more than 1000 <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> genomes, including 167 strains frequently used in bioenergy research. <i>Zymomonas mobilis</i>, an increasingly popular bacterial bioenergy research model, is also supported. CRISpy-pop is available as a web application (https://CRISpy-pop.glbrc.org/) with an intuitive graphical user interface. CRISpy-pop also cross-references the human genome to allow users to avoid the selection of guide RNAs with potential biosafety concerns.

"33858322","ChIP-BIT2: a software tool to detect weak binding events using a Bayesian integration approach.","<h4>Background</h4>ChIP-seq combines chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with sequencing and identifies genome-wide binding sites for DNA binding proteins. While many binding sites have strong ChIP-seq 'peak' observations and are well captured, there are still regions bound by proteins weakly, with a relatively low ChIP-seq signal enrichment. These weak binding sites, especially those at promoters and enhancers, are functionally important because they also regulate nearby gene expression. Yet, it remains a challenge to accurately identify weak binding sites in ChIP-seq data due to the ambiguity in differentiating these weak binding sites from the amplified background DNAs.<h4>Results</h4>ChIP-BIT2 ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/chipbitc/ ) is a software package for ChIP-seq peak detection. ChIP-BIT2 employs a mixture model integrating protein and control ChIP-seq data and predicts strong or weak protein binding sites at promoters, enhancers, or other genomic locations. For binding sites at gene promoters, ChIP-BIT2 simultaneously predicts their target genes. ChIP-BIT2 has been validated on benchmark regions and tested using large-scale ENCODE ChIP-seq data, demonstrating its high accuracy and wide applicability.<h4>Conclusion</h4>ChIP-BIT2 is an efficient ChIP-seq peak caller. It provides a better lens to examine weak binding sites and can refine or extend the existing binding site collection, providing additional regulatory regions for decoding the mechanism of gene expression regulation.","http://sourceforge.net/projects/chipbitc/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""scege"", ""net"", ""projects"", ""chipbitc"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""chip"", ""bit2"", ""a"", ""softw"", """", ""to"", ""detect"", ""weak"", ""binding"", ""events"", ""using"", ""bayesian"", ""integration"", ""approach"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>chip"", ""seq"", ""bines"", ""chromatin"", ""immunoprecipitation"", ""assays"", """", ""sequencing"", """", ""identifies"", ""genome"", ""wide"", ""binding"", ""sites"", """", ""dna"", ""proteins"", ""while"", ""many"", """", ""strong"", ""chip"", ""peak"", ""observations"", """", """", ""captured"", ""re"", ""still"", ""regions"", ""bound"", ""by"", ""weakly"", ""a"", ""relatively"", ""low"", ""signal"", ""enrichment"", ""se"", ""weak"", ""especiy"", ""those"", ""at"", ""promoters"", ""enhancers"", ""functiony"", ""important"",

"32243271","Identification of key genes and pathways associated with topotecan treatment using multiple bioinformatics tools.","<h4>Background</h4>The goal of this study is to determine critical genes and pathways associated with topotecan using publicly accessible bioinformatics tools.<h4>Methods</h4>Topotecan signatures were downloaded from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) database (http://www.ilincs.org/ilincs/). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined as genes that appeared at least three times with p values <0.05 and a fold change of ‚â•50% (|log2FC| ‚â• 0.58). Hub genes were identified by evaluating the following parameters using a protein-protein interaction network: node degrees, betweenness, and eigenfactor scores. Hub genes and the top-40 DEGs by |log2FC| were used to generate a Venn diagram, and key genes were identified. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis was performed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. Information on ovarian cancer patients derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was analyzed, and the effect of topotecan on the protein expression was examined by Western blotting.<h4>Results</h4>Eleven topotecan signatures were downloaded, and 65 upregulated and 87 downregulated DEGs were identified. Twenty-one hub genes were identified. We identified eight key genes as upregulated genes, including NFKBIA, IKBKB, GADD45A, CDKN1A, and HIST2H2BE, while EZH2, CDC20, and CDK7 were identified as downregulated genes, which play critical roles in the cell cycle and carcinogenesis in KEGG analysis. In the TCGA analysis, the CDKN1A+/EZH2- group had the longest median survival, while the CDKN1A-/EZH2+ group had the shortest median survival. Topotecan-treated murine ovarian (MOSEC), colorectal (CT26), and lung (LLC) cancer cell lines displayed upregulated CDKN1A encoding p21 and downregulated Ezh2.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Using publicly accessible bioinformatics tools, we evaluated key genes and pathways related to topotecan and examined the key genes using the TCGA database and in vitro studies.","http://www.ilincs.org/ilincs/).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", """", ""ilincs"", """")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""identification"", ""of"", ""key"", ""s"", """", ""pathways"", ""associated"", """", ""topote"", ""treatment"", ""using"", ""multiple"", ""bioinmatics"", ""s"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>"", ""goal"", ""of"", """", ""study"", ""is"", ""to"", ""determine"", ""critical"", ""s"", """", ""pathways"", ""associated"", """", ""topote"", ""using"", ""publicly"", ""accessible"", ""bioinmatics"", ""s"", ""<h4>methods<"", ""h4>topote"", ""signatures"", """", ""downloaded"", """", """", ""library"", ""integrated"", ""nerk"", ""based"", ""ular"", ""lincs"", ""base"", """", """", ""ilincs"", """", ""differentiy"", ""expressed"", ""degs"", ""defined"", ""as"", """", ""apped"", ""at"", ""least"",

"33557754","Visual4DTracker: a tool to interact with 3D + t image stacks.","<h4>Background</h4>Biological phenomena usually evolves over time and recent advances in high-throughput microscopy have made possible to collect multiple 3D images over time, generating [Formula: see text] (or 4D) datasets. To extract useful information there is the need to extract spatial and temporal data on the particles that are in the images, but particle tracking and feature extraction need some kind of assistance.<h4>Results</h4>This manuscript introduces our new freely downloadable toolbox, the Visual4DTracker. It is a MATLAB package implementing several useful functionalities to navigate, analyse and proof-read the track of each particle detected in any [Formula: see text] stack. Furthermore, it allows users to proof-read and to evaluate the traces with respect to a given gold standard. The Visual4DTracker toolbox permits the users to visualize and save all the generated results through a user-friendly graphical user interface. This tool has been successfully used in three applicative examples. The first processes synthetic data to show all the software functionalities. The second shows how to process a 4D image stack showing the time-lapse growth of Drosophila cells in an embryo. The third example presents the quantitative analysis of insulin granules in living beta-cells, showing that such particles have two main dynamics that coexist inside the cells.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Visual4DTracker is a software package for MATLAB to visualize, handle and manually track [Formula: see text] stacks of microscopy images containing objects such cells, granules, etc..

"28917032","CFS MATLAB toolbox: An experiment builder for continuous flash suppression (CFS) task.","CFS toolbox is an open-source collection of MATLAB functions that utilizes PsychToolbox-3 (PTB-3). It is designed to allow a researcher to create and run continuous flash suppression experiments using a variety of experimental parameters (i.e., stimulus types and locations, noise characteristics, and experiment window settings). In a CFS experiment, one of the eyes at a time is presented with a dynamically changing noise pattern, while the other eye is concurrently presented with a static target stimulus, such as a Gabor patch. Due to the strong interocular suppression created by the dominant noise pattern mask, the target stimulus is rendered invisible for an extended duration. Very little knowledge of MATLAB is required for using the toolbox; experiments are generated by modifying csv files with the required parameters, and result data are output to text files for further analysis.

Our development of the Pathway Tools software was motivated by the need to construct biological knowledge resources that combine these many types of data, and that enable users to find and comprehend data of interest as quickly as possible through query and visualization tools. Further, we sought to support the development of metabolic flux models from pathway databases, and to use pathway information to leverage the interpretation of high-throughput data sets.<h4>Results</h4>In the past 4 years we have enhanced the already extensive Pathway Tools software in several respects. It can now support metabolic-model execution through the Web, it provides a more accurate gap filler for metabolic models; it supports development of models for organism communities distributed across a spatial grid; and model results may be visualized graphically. Pathway Tools supports several new omics-data analysis tools including the Omics Dashboard, multi-pathway diagrams called pathway collages, a pathway-covering algorithm for metabolomics data analysis and an algorithm for generating mechanistic explanations of multi-omics data. We have also improved the core pathway/genome databases management capabilities of the software, providing new multi-organism search tools for organism communities, improved graphics rendering, faster performance and re-designed gene and metabolite pages.<h4>Availability</h4>The software is free for academic use; a fee is required for commercial use.

"32753773","hubViz: A Novel Tool for Hub-centric Visualization.","Visualization algorithms have been widely used for intuitive interrogation of genomic data and popularly used tools include MDS, t-SNE, and UMAP. However, these algorithms are not tuned for the visualization of binary data and none of them consider the hubness of observations for the visualization. In order to address these limitations, here we propose hubViz, a novel tool for hub-centric visualization of binary data. We evaluated the performance of hubViz with its application to the gene expression data measured in multiple brain regions of rats exposed to cocaine, the single-cell RNA-seq data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with interferon beta, and the literature mining data to investigate relationships among diseases. We further evaluated the performance of hubViz using simulation studies. We showed that hubViz provides effective visual inspection by locating the hub in the center and the contrasting elements in the opposite sides around the center.

"32973479","Nutil: A Pre- and Post-processing Toolbox for Histological Rodent Brain Section Images.","With recent technological advances in microscopy and image acquisition of tissue sections, further developments of tools are required for viewing, transforming, and analyzing the ever-increasing amounts of high-resolution data produced. In the field of neuroscience, histological images of whole rodent brain sections are commonly used for investigating brain connections as well as cellular and molecular organization in the normal and diseased brain, but present a problem for the typical neuroscientist with no or limited programming experience in terms of the pre- and post-processing steps needed for analysis. To meet this need we have designed <i>Nutil</i>, an open access and stand-alone executable software that enables automated transformations, post-processing, and analyses of 2D section images using multi-core processing (OpenMP). The software is written in C++ for efficiency, and provides the user with a clean and easy graphical user interface for specifying the input and output parameters. <i>Nutil</i> currently contains four separate tools: (1) A transformation toolchain named ""Transform"" that allows for rotation, mirroring and scaling, resizing, and renaming of very large tiled tiff images. (2) ""TiffCreator"" enables the generation of tiled TIFF images from other image formats such as PNG and JPEG. (3) A ""Resize"" tool completes the preprocessing toolset and allows downscaling of PNG and JPEG images with output in PNG format. (4) The fourth tool is a post-processing method called ""Quantifier"" that enables the quantification of segmented objects in the context of regions defined by brain atlas maps generated with the <i>QuickNII</i> software based on a 3D reference atlas (mouse or rat). The output consists of a set of report files, point cloud coordinate files for visualization in reference atlas space, and reference atlas images superimposed with color-coded objects.

"33882829","Gene-set distance analysis (GSDA): a powerful tool for gene-set association analysis.","<h4>Background</h4>Identifying sets of related genes (gene sets) that are empirically associated with a treatment or phenotype often yields valuable biological insights. Several methods effectively identify gene sets in which individual genes have simple monotonic relationships with categorical, quantitative, or censored event-time variables. Some distance-based methods, such as distance correlations, may detect complex non-monotone associations of a gene-set with a quantitative variable that elude other methods. However, the distance correlations have yet to be generalized to associate gene-sets with categorical and censored event-time endpoints. Also, there is a need to determine which genes empirically drive the significance of an association of a gene set with an endpoint.<h4>Results</h4>We develop gene-set distance analysis (GSDA) by generalizing distance correlations to evaluate the association of a gene set with categorical and censored event-time variables. We also develop a backward elimination procedure to identify a subset of genes that empirically drive significant associations. In simulation studies, GSDA more effectively identified complex non-monotone gene-set associations than did six other published methods. In the analysis of a pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) data set, GSDA was the only method to discover that event-free survival (EFS) was associated with the 56-gene AML pathway gene-set, narrow that result down to 5 genes, and confirm the association of those 5 genes with EFS in a separate validation cohort. These results indicate that GSDA effectively identifies and characterizes complex non-monotonic gene-set associations that are missed by other methods.<h4>Conclusion</h4>GSDA is a powerful and flexible method to detect gene-set association with categorical, quantitative, or censored event-time variables, especially to detect complex non-monotonic gene-set associations.

"29721311","Gene Unprediction with Spurio: A tool to identify spurious protein sequences.","We now have access to the sequences of tens of millions of proteins. These protein sequences are essential for modern molecular biology and computational biology. The vast majority of protein sequences are derived from gene prediction tools and have no experimental supporting evidence for their translation.  Despite the increasing accuracy of gene prediction tools there likely exists a large number of spurious protein predictions in the sequence databases.  We have developed the Spurio tool to help identify spurious protein predictions in prokaryotes.  Spurio searches the query protein sequence against a prokaryotic nucleotide database using tblastn and identifies homologous sequences. The tblastn matches are used to score the query sequence's likelihood of being a spurious protein prediction using a Gaussian process model. The most informative feature is the appearance of stop codons within the presumed translation of homologous DNA sequences. Benchmarking shows that the Spurio tool is able to distinguish spurious from true proteins. However, transposon proteins are prone to be predicted as spurious because of the frequency of degraded homologs found in the DNA sequence databases. Our initial experiments suggest that less than 1% of the proteins in the UniProtKB sequence database are likely to be spurious and that Spurio is able to identify over 60 times more spurious proteins than the AntiFam resource.

"32639365","A transcriptional toolbox for exploring peripheral neuroimmune interactions.","<h4>Abstract</h4>Correct communication between immune cells and peripheral neurons is crucial for the protection of our bodies. Its breakdown is observed in many common, often painful conditions, including arthritis, neuropathies, and inflammatory bowel or bladder disease. Here, we have characterised the immune response in a mouse model of neuropathic pain using flow cytometry and cell-type-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We found few striking sex differences, but a very persistent inflammatory response, with increased numbers of monocytes and macrophages up to 3 1/2 months after the initial injury. This raises the question of whether the commonly used categorisation of pain into ""inflammatory"" and ""neuropathic"" is one that is mechanistically appropriate.

"34236262","The prognosis of glioblastoma: a large, multifactorial study.","<h4>Objective</h4>Glioblastoma is the most common and fatal primary brain tumor in adults. Even with maximal resection and a series of postoperative adjuvant treatments, the median overall survival (OS) of glioblastoma patients remains approximately 15 months. The Huashan Hospital glioma bank contains more than 2000 glioma tissue samples with long-term follow-up data; almost half of these samples are from glioblastoma patients. Several large glioma databases with long-term follow-up data have reported outcomes of glioblastoma patients from countries other than China. We investigated the prognosis of glioblastoma patients in China and compared the survival outcomes among patients from different databases.<h4>Methods</h4>The data for 967 glioblastoma patients who underwent surgery at Huashan Hospital and had long-term follow-up records were obtained from our glioma registry (diagnosed from 29 March 2010, through 7 June 2017). Patients were eligible for inclusion if they underwent surgical resection for newly diagnosed glioblastomas and had available data of survival and personal information. Data of 778 glioblastoma patients were collected from three separate online databases (448 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, https://cancergenome.nih.gov), 191 from REpository for Molecular BRAin Neoplasia DaTa (REMBRANDT) database (GSE108476) and 132 from data set GSE16011(Hereafter called as the French database). We compared the prognosis of glioblastoma patients from records among the different databases and the changes in survival outcomes of glioblastoma patients from Huashan Hospital over an 8-year period.<h4>Results</h4>The median OS of glioblastoma patients was 16.3 (95% CI: 15.4-17.2) months for Huashan Hospital, 13.8 (95% CI: 12.9-14.9) months for TCGA, 19.3 (95% CI: 17.0-20.0) months for the REMBRANDT database, and 9.1 months for the French database. The median OS of glioblastoma patients from Huashan Hospital improved from 15.6 (2010-2013, 95% CI: 14.4-16.6) months to 18.2 (2014-2017, 95% CI: 15.8-20.6) months over the study period (2010-2017). In addition, the prognosis of glioblastoma patients with total resection was significantly better than that of glioblastoma patients with sub-total resection or biopsy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study confirms that treatment centered around maximal surgical resection brought survival benefits to glioblastoma patients after adjusting to validated prognostic factors. In addition, an improvement in prognosis was observed among glioblastoma patients from Huashan Hospital over the course of our study. We attributed it to the adoption of a new standard of neurosurgical treatment on the basis of neurosurgical multimodal technologies. Even though the prognosis of glioblastoma patients remains poor, gradual progress is being made.","https://cancergenome.nih.gov)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""cergenome"", ""nih"", ""gov"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""prognosis"", ""of"", ""glioblastoma"", ""a"", ""large"", ""multifactorial"", ""study"")","c(""<h4>objective<"", ""h4>glioblastoma"", ""is"", """", """", ""mon"", """", ""fatal"", ""primary"", ""brain"", ""tumor"", ""in"", ""adults"", ""even"", """", ""maximal"", ""resection"", ""a"", ""series"", ""of"", ""postoperative"", ""adjuvant"", ""treatments"", ""median"", """", ""survival"", ""os"", ""glioblastoma"", ""patients"", ""remains"", ""approximately"", ""15"", ""months"", ""huashan"", ""hospital"", ""glioma"", ""bank"", ""contains"", """", """", ""2000"", ""tissue"", ""samples"", ""long"", ""term"", ""follow"", ""up"", """", ""al"", ""half"",

"33348264","Combining in vivo pathohistological and redox status analysis with in silico toxicogenomic study to explore the phthalates and bisphenol A mixture-induced testicular toxicity.","The aim of this study was to: (i) determine and compare the capacity of bis (2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), bisphenol A (BPA), and their mixture to produce testicular toxicity after the subacute exposure; (ii) explore the mechanisms behind the observed changes using in silico toxicogenomic approach. Male rats were randomly split into groups (n = 6): (1) Control (corn oil); (2) DEHP (50 mg/kg b.w./day); (3) DBP (50 mg/kg b.w./day); (4) BPA (25 mg/kg b.w./day); and (5) MIX (50 mg/kg b.w./day DEHP + 50 mg/kg b.w/day DBP + 25 mg/kg b.w./day BPA). Animals were sacrificed after 28 days of oral exposure, testes were extracted and prepared for histological assessments under the light microscope (haematoxylin and eosin staining) and redox status analysis. The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; http://CTD.mdibl.org), Cytoscape software (https://cytoscape.org) and ToppGene Suite (https://toppgene.cchmc.org) were used for data-mining. Present pathohistological study has demonstrated more pronounced testicular toxicity of the MIX group (desquamated germinal epithelium cells, enlarged cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, multinucleated cell forms and intracytoplasmic vacuoles) in comparison with the single substances, while effects on redox status parameters were either more prominent, or present only in the MIX group. In silico investigation revealed 20 genes linked to male reproductive disorders, affected by all three investigated substances. Effects on metabolism, AhR pathway, apoptosis and oxidative stress could be singled out as the most probable mechanisms involved in the subacute DEHP, DBP and BPA mixture testicular toxicity, while the effect on oxidative stress parameters was confirmed by in vivo experiment.","c(""http://CTD.mdibl.org)","""","""https://cytoscape.org)""","""https://toppgene.cchmc.org)"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""c"", """", ""ctd"", ""mdibl"", """")","","c("""", """", ""cytoscape"", """")","c("""", """", ""topp"", ""cchmc"", """")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""bining"", ""in"", ""vivo"", ""pathohistological"", """", ""redox"", ""status"", ""analysis"", """", ""silico"", ""toxicogenomic"", ""study"", ""to"", ""explore"", """", ""phthalates"", ""bisphenol"", ""a"", ""mixture"", ""induced"", ""testicular"", ""toxicity"")","c("""", ""aim"", ""of"", """", ""study"", """", ""to"", ""i"", ""determine"", """", ""p"", ""capacity"", ""bis"", ""2"", ""ethylhexyl"", ""phthalate"", ""dehp"", ""dibutyl"", ""dbp"", ""bisphenol"", ""a"", ""bpa"", ""ir"", ""mixture"", ""produce"", ""testicular"", ""toxicity"", ""after"", ""subacute"", ""exposure"", ""ii"", ""explore"", ""mechanisms"", ""behind"", ""observed"", ""changes"", ""using"", ""in"", ""silico"", ""toxicogenomic"", ""approach"", ""male"", ""rats"", """", ""romly"", ""split"", """", ""groups"", ""n"", ""="", ""6"", ""1"", ""control"", ""corn"", ""oil"",

"33964156","ptm: an R package for the study of methionine sulfoxidation and other post-translational modifications.","<h4>Summary</h4>Methionine sulfoxidation is a post-translational modification playing important roles in cell signaling. Herein, we present ptm, an R package for the study of this modification. However, since many of the analyses applied to methionine modification can be extended to other modifications, the package can be useful to thoroughly analyze post-translational modifications in general. Thus, within a single software environment ptm can integrate information from up to 11 databases covering 9 modifications. Different functions can work coordinately to form pipelines allowing the programmatic analysis of thousands of proteins. Alternatively, the user can simultaneously perform different analyses on the same protein of interest, combining the results in a single output. The flexibility of ptm makes it a suitable tool to address site- and protein-centric hypotheses related to post-translational modifications. Accompanying the package we maintain a web page containing extended documentation and examples of the tasks that can be performed with ptm.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>ptm is implemented in R. Release versions are available via CRAN and work on all major operating systems. The development version is maintained at https://bitbucket.org/jcaledo/ptm.

"34126844","Incidence and prevalence of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (functional seizures): a systematic review and an analytical study.","<h4>Aim</h4>Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) or functional seizures are universal phenomena. However, data on their epidemiology is limited. The aim of the current study was to review the literature on the epidemiology of PNES and to provide analytical estimates of its incidence and prevalence based on the direct data that are available from previous studies on PNES.<h4>Methods</h4>The methods of this work had two parts: (1) MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Scopus from inception to 19 October 2019 were systematically searched. (2) The analytical study of the incidence and prevalence of PNES was performed, based on the following data from previous studies: incidence of PNES, duration of PNES before making a diagnosis, outcome and mortality of PNES.<h4>Results</h4>The search strategy yielded five articles; three were on the incidence and two on the prevalence. In the analytical part of the study, the incidence of PNES was calculated to be 3.1 (95% Confidence Interval: 1.1-5.1) per 100,000 population per year. The calculated prevalence rate of PNES in 2019 was 108.5 (95% Confidence Interval: 39.2-177.8) per 100,000 population, in the USA.<h4>Conclusion</h4>While, the generalizability of these calculated incidence and prevalence rates to other places in the world is limited, they give us a reasonable hint that PNES is a common condition and the prevalence is much more than that it was thought before.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/00207454.2021.1942870.","https://doi.org/10.1080/00207454.2021.1942870.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""doi"", """", ""10"", ""1080"", ""00207454"", ""2021"", ""1942870"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""incidence"", """", ""prevalence"", ""of"", ""psychogenic"", ""npileptic"", ""seizures"", ""functional"", ""a"", ""systematic"", ""review"", ""an"", ""analytical"", ""study"")","c(""<h4>aim<"", ""h4>psychogenic"", ""npileptic"", ""seizures"", ""pnes"", ""or"", ""functional"", """", ""universal"", ""phenomena"", ""however"", """", ""on"", ""ir"", ""epidemiology"", ""is"", ""limited"", """", ""aim"", ""of"", ""current"", ""study"", """", ""to"", ""review"", ""literature"", """", ""provide"", ""analytical"", ""estimates"", """", ""incidence"", ""prevalence"", ""based"", ""direct"", """", ""available"", """", ""previous"", ""studies"", ""<h4>methods<"", ""h4>"", ""methods"", """", ""work"", ""had"", """", ""parts"", ""1"", ""medline"",

"33416854","GWASinspector: comprehensive quality control of genome-wide association study results.","<h4>Summary</h4>Quality control (QC) of genome wide association study (GWAS) result files has become increasingly difficult due to advances in genomic technology. The main challenges include continuous increases in the number of polymorphic genetic variants contained in recent GWASs and reference panels, the rising number of cohorts participating in a GWAS consortium, and inclusion of new variant types. Here, we present GWASinspector, a flexible R package for comprehensive QC of GWAS results. This package is compatible with recent imputation reference panels, handles insertion/deletion and multi-allelic variants, provides extensive QC reports and efficiently processes big data files. Reference panels covering three human genome builds (NCBI36, GRCh37 and GRCh38) are available. GWASinspector has a user friendly design and allows easy set-up of the QC pipeline through a configuration file. In addition to checking and reporting on individual files, it can be used in preparation of a meta-analysis by testing for systemic differences between studies and generating cleaned, harmonized GWAS files. Comparison with existing GWAS QC tools shows that the main advantages of GWASinspector are its ability to more effectively deal with insertion/deletion and multi-allelic variants and its relatively low memory use.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Our package is available at The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GWASinspector.

"33204420","Risk factors, clinical outcomes and predictors of stroke mortality in Sierra Leoneans: A retrospective hospital cohort study.","<h4>Background</h4>Stroke data from Sierra Leone is limited, despite the increase in global burden of the disease. The aim of this study was to assess the risk factors, clinical outcomes and predictors of stroke mortality at a tertiary hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective cohort study was conducted on stroke patients admitted at the Connaught Teaching Hospital between 1st January to December 31, 2018. Clinical data related to stroke, with variables including patients' demographics, stroke subtype, vascular risk factors, modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and outcomes were documented. In-hospital mortality, associated risk factors and predictors of stroke were determined. The study was approved by the Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Committee. It was registered under Research Registry https://www.researchregistry.com/browse-the-registry#home/with the unique identifying number researchregistry6009.<h4>Result</h4>We studied 178 (95 male and 83 female) patients. The mean age was 59.8 ¬± 14.0 years, median was 58.1years (ranging: 29-88 years). The commonest risk factors were hypertension (84.3%), tobacco smoking (35.9%) and alcohol (31.4%). Ischemic stroke confirmed by CT scan was 76.3%. In-hospital mortality was 34.8% and at discharge, mean modified Rankin Score (mRS) was 3.89 ¬± 1.62. The independent predictors for stroke mortality were: hypertension [AOR = 2.2; C.I 95%: (1.32-3.80), p = 0.001], previous stroke [AOR = 2.31; C.I 95%: (1.43-5.74), p = 0.001], GCS < 8 [AOR = 6.06; C.I 95%: (3.17-12.79), p < 0.001], clinical diagnosis in the absence of imaging [AOR = 3.11; C.I 95%: (2.1-9.87), p = 0.001], hemorrhagic stroke [AOR = 2.96; C.I 95%: (1.96-9.54), p < 0.001], and aspiration pneumonia [(AOR = 3.03; C.I 95%:(1.44-6.36), p = 0.001]. Women had poorer outcome than men.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study highlights a high stroke mortality in a resource limited hospital, with some stroke patients having difficulties in accessing Computer Tomogram (CT) scan services.

"34122055","Impact of Total Epinephrine Dose on Long Term Neurological Outcome for Cardiac Arrest Patients: A Cohort Study.","<b>Introduction:</b> Although epinephrine is universally acknowledged to increase return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after cardiac arrest, its balanced effects on later outcomes remain uncertain, causing potential harm during post-resuscitation phase. Recent studies have questioned the efficacy and potential deleterious effects of epinephrine on long-term survival and neurological outcomes, despite that the adverse relationship between epinephrine dose and outcome can be partially biased by longer CPR duration and underlying comorbidities. This study explored the long-term effect of epinephrine when used in a cohort of patients that underwent cardiac arrest during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. <b>Methods:</b> The data were originally collected from a retrospective institutional database from January 2007 to December 2015 and are now available on Dryad (via: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.qv6fp83). Use of epinephrine was coded by dose (<2 mg, 2 mg, 3-4 mg, ‚â•5 mg). A favorable neurological outcome was defined using a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1 or 2. The association between epinephrine dosing and 3-months neurological outcome was analyzed by univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression. <b>Results:</b> Univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated a negative association between total epinephrine dose and neurological outcome. Of the 373 eligible patients, 92 received less than 2 mg of epinephrine, 60 received 2 mg, 97 received 3-4 mg and 124 received more than 5 mg. Compared to patients who received less than 2 mg of epinephrine, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of a favorable neurological outcome was 0.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38-1.68) for 2 mg of epinephrine, 0.43 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21-0.89) for 3-4 mg of epinephrine and 0.40 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17-0.96) for more than 5 mg of epinephrine. <b>Conclusion:</b> In this cohort of patients who achieved ROSC, total epinephrine dosing during resuscitation was associated with a worse neurological outcome three months after cardiac arrest, after adjusting other confounding factors. Further researches are needed to investigate the long-term effect of epinephrine on cardiac arrest patients.","https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.qv6fp83).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""doi"", """", ""10"", ""5061"", ""dryad"", ""qv6fp83"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""impact"", ""of"", ""total"", ""epinephrine"", ""dose"", ""on"", ""long"", ""term"", ""neurological"", ""oute"", """", ""cardiac"", ""arrest"", ""patients"", ""a"", ""cohort"", ""study"")","c(""<b>introduction"", ""<"", ""b>"", ""although"", ""epinephrine"", ""is"", ""universy"", ""acknowledged"", ""to"", ""increase"", ""return"", ""of"", ""spontaneous"", ""circulation"", ""rosc"", ""after"", ""cardiac"", ""arrest"", """", ""balanced"", ""effects"", ""on"", ""later"", ""outes"", ""remain"", ""uncertain"", ""causing"", ""potential"", ""harm"", ""during"", ""post"", ""resuscitation"", ""pe"", ""recent"", ""studies"", """", ""questid"", """", ""efficacy"", """", ""deleterious"", ""long"", ""term"", ""survival"", ""neurological"", ""despite"", """",

"34085565","Patterns of Nutrient Intake in Relation to Gastric Cancer: A Case Control Study.","Gastric Cancer (GC) is the most common cancer among Iranian men. We conducted a case-control study to investigate the association between patterns of nutrient intake and the risk of GC in Iran. We enrolled 178 GC patients and 271 controls matched for age and sex. We collected dietary intakes using a validated diet history questionnaire. We performed factor analysis on 28 nutrients using multivariate logistic regression models on tertiles of factor scores and estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We identified three nutrient patterns. The first pattern included pantothenic acid, riboflavin, zinc, animal protein, and calcium. Selenium, thiamin, carbohydrate, vegetable protein, niacin and low intake of vitamin E loaded the second pattern, and the third pattern was abundant in fiber, carotene, vitamin C and A. We found no significant association between GC and any of the dietary patterns. However, in the first patterns, men in the highest tertile had significantly higher odds of GC than the lowest (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.13-4.09, p trend = 0.02). A dietary pattern loaded by animal products may increase the risk of GC among Iranian men. Larger studies are required to approve these findings in overall and in different subgroups.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2021.1931697.","https://doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2021.1931697.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""doi"", """", ""10"", ""1080"", ""01635581"", ""2021"", ""1931697"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""patterns"", ""of"", ""nutrient"", ""intake"", ""in"", ""relation"", ""to"", ""gastric"", ""cer"", ""a"", ""case"", ""control"", ""study"")","c(""gastric"", ""cer"", ""gc"", ""is"", """", """", ""mon"", ""among"", ""iranian"", ""men"", ""we"", ""conducted"", ""a"", ""case"", ""control"", ""study"", ""to"", ""investigate"", ""association"", ""between"", ""patterns"", ""of"", ""nutrient"", ""intake"", """", ""risk"", ""in"", ""iran"", ""enrolled"", ""178"", ""patients"", ""271"", ""controls"", ""matched"", """", ""age"", ""sex"", ""collected"", ""dietary"", ""intakes"", ""using"", ""validated"", ""diet"", ""history"", ""questionnaire"", ""permed"", ""factor"", ""analysis"", ""on"", ""28"", ""nutrients"", ""multivariate"",

Inter- and intra-observer variability was assessed, and the computerized CIMT values were compared with those manually obtained. The CIMT measurements were used to assess the correlation with clinical parameters, cardiovascular event prediction through a generalized linear model and the Kaplan-Meier hazard ratio. CIMT measurements obtained with a skilled analyst's segmentation and the computerized segmentation were comparable in statistical analyses, suggesting they can be used interchangeably for CIMT quantification and clinical outcome investigation.

We then reanalyze data (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ4,244) previously examined by Richardson et al. (Evolutionary Psychology, 15(1), 2017, https://doi.org/10.1177/1474704916666840 to determine whether (a) previously reported evidence of multidimensionality is robust to the modeling approach employed and (b) the structure of LH indicators is invariant by sex. Findings provide further evidence that a single LH dimension is implausible and that researchers should cease interpreting K-factor scores as empirical proxies for LH speed. In contrast to the original study, we detected a small inverse correlation between mating competition and Super-K that is consistent with a trade-off. Tests of measurement invariance across the sexes revealed evidence of metric invariance (i.e., equivalence of factor loadings), consistent with the theory that K is a proximate cause of its indicators; however, evidence of partial scalar invariance suggests use of scores likely introduces bias when the sexes are compared. We discuss limitations and identify approaches that researchers may use to further evaluate the validity of the K-factor and other applications of LH to human variation.","https://doi.org/10.1177/1474704916666840",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""doi"", """", ""10"", ""1177"", ""1474704916666840"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""advancing"", """", ""psychometric"", ""study"", ""of"", ""human"", ""life"", ""history"", ""indicators"", ""k"", ""does"", """", ""measure"", ""speed"", ""but"", ""ory"", """", ""evidence"", ""suggest"", ""it"", ""deserves"", ""furr"", ""attention"")","c(""in"", """", ""article"", ""we"", ""attend"", ""to"", ""recent"", ""critiques"", ""of"", ""psychometric"", ""applications"", ""life"", ""history"", ""lh"", ""ory"", ""variance"", ""among"", ""humans"", """", ""develop"", ""advance"", """", ""study"", ""latent"", ""constructs"", ""n"", ""reanalyze"", """", ""n"", ""äâ="", ""äâ4"", ""244"", ""previously"", ""examined"", ""by"", ""richardson"", ""et"", ""al"", ""evolutionary"", ""psychology"", ""15"", ""1"", ""2017"", """", ""doi"", """", ""10"", ""1177"", ""1474704916666840"", ""determine"", ""wher"", ""a"", ""reported"",

"34013642","Efficient study design to estimate population means with multiple measurement instruments.","Outcomes from studies assessing exposure often use multiple measurements.

In this article, we propose a tool for efficient design of studies that include both direct and indirect measurements of a relevant outcome. Based on data from a pilot or preliminary study, the tool, which is available online as a shiny app at https://michalbitan.shinyapps.io/shinyApp/, can be used to compute: (1) the sample size required for a statistical power analysis, while optimizing the percent of participants who should provide direct measures of exposure (biomarkers) in addition to the indirect (self-report) measures provided by all participants; (2) the ideal number of replicates; and (3) the allocation of resources to intervention and control arms. In addition we show how to examine the sensitivity of results to underlying assumptions. We illustrate our analysis using studies of tobacco smoke exposure and nutrition.

"34074827","Influence of Sedation on the Detection Rate of Early Cancer and Precancerous Lesions During Diagnostic Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopies: A Multicenter Retrospective Study.","<h4>Introduction</h4>The influence of sedation on the endoscopic detection rate of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) early cancer (EC) and precancerous lesions, including high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) and low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, has not been assessed. The aim of this research is to assess whether the use of sedation can help improve the detection rate of UGI EC and precancerous lesions. The second objective is to evaluate its potential influencing factors.<h4>Methods</h4>The study includes 432,202 patients from a multicenter database from January 2012 to July 2019. Information on endoscopic findings and histology biopsies was obtained from endoscopy quality-control system. Associations of sedation with the detection rate of EC and precancerous lesions were assessed.<h4>Results</h4>The sedation group has a higher detection rate of UGI EC and HGIN compared with the no-sedation group, whereas the detection rate of low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia was similar between the 2 groups. There were more cases examined by using staining, image enhancement, or magnifying techniques in the sedation group (P < 0.001). And, the mean observation time was also longer in the sedation group (P < 0.001). The type 0-IIb esophageal HGIN and EC cases were significantly increased in the sedation group. No significant difference was detected on lesion subtypes for gastric HGIN and EC according to the Paris classification. More gastric HGIN and EC were detected at gastric body in the sedation group (P = 0.001).<h4>Discussion</h4>Sedation may improve the endoscopic detection rate of EC and HGIN in the UGI tract probably through enhancing the use of accessary endoscopic techniques, prolonging observation time, and taking more biopsies in different locations (see Visual Abstract, Supplementary Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/AJG/B926).","http://links.lww.com/AJG/B926).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""links"", ""lww"", """", ""ajg"", ""b926"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""influence"", ""of"", ""sedation"", ""on"", """", ""detection"", ""rate"", ""early"", ""cer"", """", ""precerous"", ""lesions"", ""during"", ""diagnostic"", ""upper"", ""gastrointestinal"", ""endoscopies"", ""a"", ""multicenter"", ""retrospective"", ""study"")","c(""<h4>introduction<"", ""h4>"", ""influence"", ""of"", ""sedation"", ""on"", """", ""endoscopic"", ""detection"", ""rate"", ""upper"", ""gastrointestinal"", ""ugi"", ""early"", ""cer"", ""ec"", """", ""precerous"", ""lesions"", ""including"", """", ""grade"", ""intraepilial"", ""neoplasia"", ""hgin"", ""low"", """", """", """", ""assessed"", ""aim"", """", ""research"", ""is"", ""to"", ""assess"", ""wher"", """", """", ""help"", ""improve"", ""second"", ""objective"", ""evaluate"", """", ""potential"", ""influencing"", ""factors"", ""<h4>methods<"",

"33297866","Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Thrombolysis (0.6 mg/kg) Was Beneficial for Unknown Onset Stroke Above a Certain Core Size: THAWS RCT Substudy.","<h4>Background and purpose</h4>We determined to identify patients with unknown onset stroke who could have favorable 90-day outcomes after low-dose thrombolysis from the THAWS (Thrombolysis for Acute Wake-Up and Unclear-Onset Strokes With Alteplase at 0.6 mg/kg) database.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a subanalysis of an investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized, open-label, blinded-end point trial. Patients with stroke with a time last-known-well >4.5 hours who showed a mismatch between diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive alteplase at 0.6 mg/kg intravenously or standard medical treatment. The patients were dichotomized by ischemic core size or National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and the effects of assigned treatments were compared in each group. The efficacy outcome was favorable outcome at 90 days, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1.<h4>Results</h4>The median DWI-Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) was 9, and the median ischemic core volume was 2.5 mL. Both favorable outcome (47.1% versus 48.3%) and any intracranial hemorrhage (26% versus 14%) at 22 to 36 hours were comparable between the 68 thrombolyzed patients and the 58 control patients. There was a significant treatment-by-cohort interaction for favorable outcome between dichotomized patients by ASPECTS on DWI (<i>P</i>=0.026) and core volume (<i>P</i>=0.035). Favorable outcome was more common in the alteplase group than in the control group in patients with DWI-ASPECTS 5 to 8 (RR, 4.75 [95% CI, 1.33-30.2]), although not in patients with DWI-ASPECTS 9 to 10. Favorable outcome tended to be more common in the alteplase group than in the control group in patients with core volume >6.4 mL (RR, 6.15 [95% CI, 0.87-43.64]), although not in patients with volume ‚â§6.4 mL. The frequency of any intracranial hemorrhage did not differ significantly between the 2 treatment groups in any dichotomized patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Patients developing unknown onset stroke with DWI-ASPECTS 5 to 8 showed favorable outcomes more commonly after low-dose thrombolysis than after standard treatment.

"33770801","Progression of Postural Asymmetry in Young Adults With Cerebral Palsy Who Are Not Walking: An Exploratory Study.","<h4>Purpose</h4>Young adults with cerebral palsy (CP) who are not walking are at risk of developing or increasing musculoskeletal asymmetries affecting the rib cage, spine, pelvis, and hips. This longitudinal study aimed to explore postural change using the Goldsmith Indices of Body Symmetry (GIofBS) over an 18-month period in adults with CP who are not walking.<h4>Methods</h4>Demographic and medical data were accessed from participant's history. Posture was recorded using the GIofBS to collect data during an 18-month period following skeletal maturity.<h4>Results</h4>All participants had postural asymmetry at study onset with evidence of minimal change in some GIofBS outcome measures and fluctuations in other outcomes over 18 months.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Physical therapists may use the GIofBS across the lifespan to screen for deterioration in musculoskeletal status or in assessing longer-term outcomes of interventions impacting posture in this complex population.<h4>Video abstract</h4>For more insights from the authors, see Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/PPT/A314.","http://links.lww.com/PPT/A314.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""links"", ""lww"", """", ""ppt"", ""a314"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""progression"", ""of"", ""postural"", ""asymmetry"", ""in"", ""young"", ""adults"", """", ""cerebral"", ""palsy"", ""who"", """", """", ""walking"", ""an"", ""exploratory"", ""study"")","c(""<h4>purpose<"", ""h4>young"", ""adults"", """", ""cerebral"", ""palsy"", ""cp"", ""who"", """", """", ""walking"", ""at"", ""risk"", ""of"", ""developing"", ""or"", ""increasing"", ""musculoskeletal"", ""asymmetries"", ""affecting"", """", ""rib"", ""cage"", ""spine"", ""pelvis"", """", ""hips"", """", ""longitudinal"", ""study"", ""aimed"", ""to"", ""explore"", ""postural"", ""change"", ""using"", ""goldsmith"", ""indices"", ""body"", ""symmetry"", ""giofbs"", """", ""an"", ""18"", ""month"", ""period"", ""in"", ""<h4>methods<"", ""h4>demographic"", ""medical"", """",

"34181220","The First Nations Food, Nutrition and Environment Study (2008-2018)-rationale, design, methods and lessons learned.","<h4>Objective</h4>To describe the rationale, the participatory nature of the methodology, and the lessons learned during the First Nations Food, Nutrition and Environment Study (FNFNES), a community-based participatory research project implemented in eight Assembly of First Nations regions, which includes the entirety of Canada south of the 60<sup>th</sup> parallel.<h4>Methods</h4>FNFNES respected the First Nations principles of Ownership, Control, Access and Possession (OCAP¬Æ) ( https://fnigc.ca/ocap ). A random sampling strategy based on an ecosystem framework comprising 11 ecozones was adopted to collect representative nutritional and environmental health results for all First Nations adults living on-reserve south of the 60<sup>th</sup> parallel. Data collection occurred during the fall months from 2008 to 2016. Respective First Nations were involved in the planning and implementation of data collection for the five principal components: household interviews, tap water sampling for metals, surface water sampling for pharmaceuticals, hair sampling for mercury, and traditional food sampling for contaminants.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 6487 adults from 92 First Nations participated in the Study (participation rate 78%). A higher percentage of females (66%) participated than males (34%). The average age of males and females was similar (44 and 45 years, respectively). This study offers a novel body of coherent and regionally representative evidence on the human dimension of the ongoing environmental degradation affecting First Nations.<h4>Conclusion</h4>FNFNES serves as a good example of participatory research. We encourage public health professionals to develop policy and programs building on the participatory dimension of the research as well as on its results. The information collected by the FNFNES is also important for community empowerment, environmental stewardship and the general promotion of good health by and for First Nations peoples in Canada.","https://fnigc.ca/ocap",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""fnigc"", ""ca"", ""ocap"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""first"", ""nations"", ""food"", ""nutrition"", """", ""environment"", ""study"", ""2008"", ""2018"", ""rationale"", ""design"", ""methods"", ""lessons"", ""learned"")","c(""<h4>objective<"", ""h4>to"", ""describe"", """", ""rationale"", ""participatory"", ""nature"", ""of"", ""methodology"", """", ""lessons"", ""learned"", ""during"", ""first"", ""nations"", ""food"", ""nutrition"", ""environment"", ""study"", ""fnfnes"", ""a"", ""munity"", ""based"", ""research"", ""project"", ""implemented"", ""in"", ""eight"", ""assembly"", ""regions"", ""which"", ""includes"", ""entirety"", ""ada"", ""south"", ""60<sup>th<"", ""sup>"", ""parel"", ""<h4>methods<"", ""h4>fnfnes"", ""respected"", ""principles"", ""ownership"", ""control"", ""access"",

"32926411","Quantitative SEM characterisation of ceramic target prior and after magnetron sputtering: a case study of aluminium zinc oxide.","Till now electron microscopy techniques have not been used to evaluate the plasma-target interactions undergone during the magnetron sputtering process. The destructive nature of this interaction severely alters the target microstructure. Utilising quantitative microscopy techniques can shed light on the complex plasma and solid-state processes involved which can ultimately lead to improved functional thin film deposition. As a representative functional material, aluminium-doped-zinc oxide (AZO) is an upcoming alternative to conventional transparent electrode wherein the process optimisation is of great importance. In this paper, we evaluate the pre- and post-sputter field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) data for ceramic AZO target fabricated at three final sintering temperatures (1100¬∞C, 1200¬∞C and 1300¬∞C). In all cases, grain boundaries are merged in addition to a visible reduction in the secondary phases which makes segmentation-based image analysis challenging. Through surface statistics (i.e. fractal dimension, autocorrelation length, texture aspect ratio and entropy) as a function of magnification we can quantify the electron microscopy image of the microstructure. We show that the plasma-microstructure interaction leads to an increase in autocorrelation length, texture aspect ratio and entropy for the optimum AZO ceramic sputtering target sintered at 1200¬∞C. Furthermore, a maximum reduction in fractal dimension span (as determined by exponential regression) is also observed for 1200¬∞C. In addition to the evaluation of plasma effects on sintering, our approach can provide a window towards understanding the underlying thin film growth mechanisms. We believe that this technique can be applied to the defect characterisation of a wide range of polycrystalline ceramic sputtering targets (e.g. ITO, CZTS, GAZO and so on) with the ultimate goal of improving the magnetron sputtering process and the resulting functional thin film. LAY DESCRIPTION: Magnetron sputtering allows scientists to make functional thin films on the order of the nanoscale. In this technique, atoms are plucked from a 'target' then placed onto a substrate forming a thin nanometric film: all thanks to magnets, a special power supply and the fourth state of matter (plasma). Understanding what is going on and how to make a 'good' thin film is important for making better light emitting diodes, solar cells and light sensors. Scientists use electron microscopy to see what is going on in the microstructure of the sputtered thin films to fine tune the sputtering recipe. Here, for the first time, we have applied electron microscopy to see the surface of the microstructure before and after magnetron sputtering. This will help us understanding the plasma-microstructure interaction allowing us to make more informed decisions when fine-tuning the sputtering process to get improved thin films. This is a case study of aluminium-doped zinc oxide (AZO) target that could potentially replace indium tin oxide (ITO), which is widely used as a transparent electrode in devices involving light and electricity. In this case, improved characteristics would be lower electrical resistivity and higher transmission of light. We show that it is possible to use a mathematical description (e.g. the fractal dimension) of the scanning electron microscopy picture to show a link between the target surface and the functional properties.

"33794377","Identifying Novel Drug Targets by iDTPnd: A Case Study of Kinase Inhibitors.","Current FDA-approved kinase inhibitors cause diverse adverse effects, some of which are due to the mechanism-independent effects of these drugs. Identifying these mechanism-independent interactions could improve drug safety and support drug repurposing. We have developed iDTPnd (integrated Drug Target Predictor with negative dataset), a computational approach for large-scale discovery of novel targets for known drugs. For a given drug, we construct a positive and a negative structural signature that captures the weakly conserved structural features of drug binding sites. To facilitate assessment of unintended targets, iDTPnd also provides a docking-based interaction score and its statistical significance. We were able to confirm the interaction of sorafenib, imatinib, dasatinib, sunitinib, and pazopanib with their known targets at a sensitivity and specificity of 52% and 55%, respectively. We have validated 10 predicted novel targets by using in vitro experiments. Our results suggest that proteins other than kinases, such as nuclear receptors, cytochrome P450, or MHC Class I molecules can also be physiologically relevant targets of kinase inhibitors.

"34092780","Transcultural Adaptation of Tibetan Nursing Trainees: A Case Study of ""9+3"" Vocational Technical Students in Sichuan Province, China.","BACKGROUND Nursing education is an important part of the ""9+3"" vocational education program led by Sichuan Province. In the internship stage, nursing students of Tibetan ethnicity may have problems of intercultural adaptation in the process of getting along with patients, which may affect the effective nursing outcome. The purpose of this study was to clarify the current situation of transcultural adaptation of Tibetan trainee nurses and to provide more theoretical support and guidance. MATERIAL AND METHODS We collected 237 valid survey questionnaires, based on Ward's acculturation process model, from a total of 363 Tibetan trainee nurses in the ""9+3"" free vocational education program in Chengdu, Luzhou, and Nanchong of Sichuan Province. The SPSSAU project (2020), an online application software retrieved from https://www.spssau.com, was used for data coding and archiving. RESULTS The results of questionnaire and data analysis showed that the overall level of transcultural adaptation of Tibetan trainee nurses was that the number of people with poor adaptation was slightly higher than those with good adaptation, and most Tibetan trainee nurses were in the middle level. Meanwhile, sociocultural adaptation was better than psychological adaptation. There were no statistically significant differences among the 4 grouping variables: gender, student home region, the city where the internship hospital was located, and whether they were from a single-child family or not. CONCLUSIONS The results revealed that there was still transcultural maladjustment among Tibetan nurses in the internship stage, and the psychological maladjustment was more obvious than the sociocultural maladjustment.

"33316147","Older Adults' Engagement in Technology-Mediated Self-Monitoring of Diet: A Mixed-Method Study.","<h4>Purpose</h4>This feasibility study explored older adults' use of a nutrition app called Appetitus (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/appetitt/id1001936854?ign-mpt=uo%3D2; https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nr.appetitt&hl=e) and addressed their engagement in technology-mediated self-monitoring of diet. Undernutrition is a significant challenge among older adults and is associated with poorer health experiences. Digital health for self-monitoring of diet has the potential to increase awareness of personal nutrition, and the scarcity of research reporting older adults' ability and willingness to engage in technology-mediated dietary self-monitoring warranted this study.<h4>Design and methods</h4>An explorative mixed-methods design combining descriptive analysis of log data with qualitative analysis of interviews with Appetitus users was implemented.<h4>Findings</h4>Twenty-five older adults self-monitored their diet using Appetitus over an 8-week trial period. Eighty percent of the participants used the app regularly in the trial period. The most engaged users recorded their food consumption daily for 8 weeks. Personal interest in nutrition and commitment to the project facilitated regular use of Appetitus. Poor health and the perception that using a nutrition app lacked personal relevance contributed to irregular self-monitoring. For inexperienced technology users, participation in this project became a springboard to using tablet technology and the Internet beyond the Appetitus app.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The majority of the participants regularly used Appetitus for self-monitoring of diet; they found the tablet technology and Appetitus app easy to use.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>Older adults are able and willing to use self-monitoring tools. Nutrition apps can empower older adults to make better informed decisions about their diet. Patients' self-monitoring can provide valuable and detailed health-related information to healthcare professionals and mediate patient-centered care practices.","c(""https://apps.apple.com/us/app/appetitt/id1001936854?ign-mpt=uo%3D2;""","""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nr.appetitt&hl=e)"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""c"", """", ""apps"", ""apple"", """", ""us"", ""app"", ""appetitt"", ""id1001936854"", ""ign"", ""mpt"", ""uo"", ""3d2"")","c("""", """", ""play"", ""google"", """", ""store"", ""apps"", ""details"", ""id"", ""no"", ""nr"", ""appetitt"", ""hl"", ""e"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""older"", ""adults"", ""engagement"", ""in"", ""technology"", ""mediated"", ""self"", ""monitoring"", ""of"", ""diet"", ""a"", ""mixed"", ""method"", ""study"")","c(""<h4>purpose<"", ""h4>"", ""feasibility"", ""study"", ""explored"", ""older"", ""adults"", """", ""of"", ""a"", ""nutrition"", ""app"", ""ced"", ""appetitus"", """", ""apps"", ""apple"", """", ""us"", ""appetitt"", ""id1001936854"", ""ign"", ""mpt=uo"", ""3d2"", ""play"", ""google"", ""store"", ""details"", ""id=no"", ""nr"", ""hl=e"", """", ""addressed"", ""ir"", ""engagement"", ""in"", ""technology"", ""mediated"", ""self"", ""monitoring"", ""diet"", ""undernutrition"", ""is"", ""signifit"", ""chenge"", ""among"", ""associated"", """", ""poorer"", ""health"",

"34096320","Treated HIV Infection and Progression of Carotid Atherosclerosis in Rural Uganda: A Prospective Observational Cohort Study.","Background Although ‚âà70% of the world's population of people living with HIV reside in sub-Saharan Africa, there are minimal prospective data on the contributions of HIV infection to atherosclerosis in the region. Methods and Results We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy >40 years of age in rural Uganda, along with population-based comparators not infected with HIV. We collected data on cardiovascular disease risk factors and carotid ultrasound measurements annually. We fitted linear mixed effects models, adjusted for cardiovascular disease risk factors, to estimate the association between HIV serostatus and progression of carotid intima media thickness (cIMT). We enrolled 155 people living with HIV and 154 individuals not infected with HIV and collected cIMT images at 1045 visits during a median of 4 annual visits per participant (interquartile range 3-4, range 1-5). Age (median 50.9 years) and sex (49% female) were similar by HIV serostatus. At enrollment, there was no difference in mean cIMT by HIV serostatus (0.665 versus 0.680 mm, <i>P</i>=0.15). In multivariable models, increasing age, blood pressure, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were associated with greater cIMT (<i>P</i><0.05), however change in cIMT per year was also no different by HIV serostatus (0.004 mm/year for HIV negative [95% CI, 0.001-0.007 mm], 0.006 mm/year for people living with HIV [95% CI, 0.003-0.008 mm], HIV√ótime interaction <i>P</i>=0.25). Conclusions In rural Uganda, treated HIV infection was not associated with faster cIMT progression. These results do not support classification of treated HIV infection as a risk factor for subclinical atherosclerosis progression in rural sub-Saharan Africa.

"29724163","EuGI: a novel resource for studying genomic islands to facilitate horizontal gene transfer detection in eukaryotes.","BACKGROUND:Genomic islands (GIs) are inserts of foreign DNA that have potentially arisen through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). There are evidences that GIs can contribute significantly to the evolution of prokaryotes. The acquisition of GIs through HGT in eukaryotes has, however, been largely unexplored. In this study, the previously developed GI prediction tool, SeqWord Gene Island Sniffer (SWGIS), is modified to predict GIs in eukaryotic chromosomes. Artificial simulations are used to estimate ratios of predicting false positive and false negative GIs by inserting GIs into different test chromosomes and performing the SWGIS v2.0 algorithm. Using SWGIS v2.0, GIs are then identified in 36 fungal, 22 protozoan and 8 invertebrate genomes. RESULTS:SWGIS v2.0 predicts GIs in large eukaryotic chromosomes based on the atypical nucleotide composition of these regions. Averages for predicting false negative and false positive GIs were 20.1% and 11.01% respectively. A total of 10,550 GIs were identified in 66 eukaryotic species with 5299 of these GIs coding for at least one functional protein. The EuGI web-resource, freely accessible at http://eugi.bi.up.ac.za , was developed that allows browsing the database created from identified GIs and genes within GIs through an interactive and visual interface. CONCLUSIONS:SWGIS v2.0 along with the EuGI database, which houses GIs identified in 66 different eukaryotic species, and the EuGI web-resource, provide the first comprehensive resource for studying HGT in eukaryotes.","http://eugi.bi.up.ac.za",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""eugi"", ""bi"", ""up"", ""ac"", ""za"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""eugi"", ""a"", ""novel"", ""resce"", """", ""studying"", ""genomic"", ""isls"", ""to"", ""facilitate"", ""horizontal"", """", ""transfer"", ""detection"", ""in"", ""eukaryotes"")","c(""background"", ""genomic"", ""isls"", ""gis"", """", ""inserts"", ""of"", ""eign"", ""dna"", """", """", ""potentiy"", ""arisen"", ""through"", ""horizontal"", """", ""transfer"", ""hgt"", ""re"", ""evidences"", """", ""contribute"", ""signifitly"", ""to"", """", ""evolution"", ""prokaryotes"", ""acquisition"", ""in"", ""eukaryotes"", """", ""however"", """", ""largely"", ""unexplored"", """", ""study"", ""previously"", ""developed"", ""gi"", ""prediction"", """", ""seqword"", ""isl"", ""sniffer"", ""swgis"", ""is"", ""modified"", ""predict"",

"33180722","A Benchmark for Studying Diabetic Retinopathy: Segmentation, Grading, and Transferability.","People with diabetes are at risk of developing an eye disease called diabetic retinopathy (DR). This disease occurs when high blood glucose levels cause damage to blood vessels in the retina. Computer-aided DR diagnosis has become a promising tool for the early detection and severity grading of DR, due to the great success of deep learning. However, most current DR diagnosis systems do not achieve satisfactory performance or interpretability for ophthalmologists, due to the lack of training data with consistent and fine-grained annotations. To address this problem, we construct a large fine-grained annotated DR dataset containing 2,842 images (FGADR). Specifically, this dataset has 1,842 images with pixel-level DR-related lesion annotations, and 1,000 images with image-level labels graded by six board-certified ophthalmologists with intra-rater consistency. The proposed dataset will enable extensive studies on DR diagnosis. Further, we establish three benchmark tasks for evaluation: 1. DR lesion segmentation; 2. DR grading by joint classification and segmentation; 3. Transfer learning for ocular multi-disease identification. Moreover, a novel inductive transfer learning method is introduced for the third task. Extensive experiments using different state-of-the-art methods are conducted on our FGADR dataset, which can serve as baselines for future research.

"34180600","Primary antibiotic resistance of Helicobacter pylori isolates is twofold more frequent in HIV-positive than HIV-negative individuals: A descriptive observational study.","The antimicrobial susceptibility of Helicobacter pylori strains isolated from HIV-positive individuals is not well characterized. This study aimed to measure the prevalence and long-term trends associated with primary H. pylori antibiotic resistance, evaluate correlations with antibiotic consumption, and compare predictors for H. pylori antibiotic resistance between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. In this longitudinal registry study, we evaluated consecutive adults with and without HIV infection, na√Øve to H. pylori treatment, who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and had a positive H. pylori culture, with susceptibility testing available, between 2004 and 2015. Outpatient antibiotic consumption data were based on nationwide aggregated numbers. H. pylori was isolated from gastric biopsies of 3008/8321 patients, 181/477 (37.9%) were HIV-positive and 2827/7844 (36.0%) HIV-negative. Overall cohort mean prevalence of H. pylori primary antibiotic resistance was 11.1% for clarithromycin, 17.8% levofloxacin, and 39.4% metronidazole. The prevalence of H. pylori primary resistance was significantly higher for these three drugs in HIV-positive individuals across the study period. Linear regression showed that the prevalence of clarithromycin and levofloxacin resistance correlated with the country aggregate daily dose consumption of macrolides and quinolones, respectively. Multivariable regression analysis showed that HIV infection is a strong independent risk factor for multiple H. pylori antibiotic resistance. In summary, HIV infection is a risk factor for carrying multi-resistant H. pylori strains and this is correlated with antibiotic consumption. Empirical therapies should be avoided in HIV-positive individuals. These data highlight the need to implement ongoing monitoring of H. pylori antimicrobial susceptibility among HIV-positive individuals.

"32699131","Febrile Illness Evaluation in a Broad Range of Endemicities (FIEBRE): protocol for a multisite prospective observational study of the causes of fever in Africa and Asia.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Fever commonly leads to healthcare seeking and hospital admission in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. There is only limited guidance for clinicians managing non-malarial fevers, which often results in inappropriate treatment for patients. Furthermore, there is little evidence for estimates of disease burden, or to guide empirical therapy, control measures, resource allocation, prioritisation of clinical diagnostics or antimicrobial stewardship. The Febrile Illness Evaluation in a Broad Range of Endemicities (FIEBRE) study seeks to address these information gaps.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>FIEBRE investigates febrile illness in paediatric and adult outpatients and inpatients using standardised clinical, laboratory and social science protocols over a minimum 12-month period at five sites in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeastern and Southern Asia. Patients presenting with fever are enrolled and provide clinical data, pharyngeal swabs and a venous blood sample; selected participants also provide a urine sample. Laboratory assessments target infections that are treatable and/or preventable. Selected point-of-care tests, as well as blood and urine cultures and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, are performed on site. On day 28, patients provide a second venous blood sample for serology and information on clinical outcome. Further diagnostic assays are performed at international reference laboratories. Blood and pharyngeal samples from matched community controls enable calculation of AFs, and surveys of treatment seeking allow estimation of the incidence of common infections. Additional assays detect markers that may differentiate bacterial from non-bacterial causes of illness and/or prognosticate illness severity. Social science research on antimicrobial use will inform future recommendations for fever case management. Residual samples from participants are stored for future use.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>Ethics approval was obtained from all relevant institutional and national committees; written informed consent is obtained from all participants or parents/guardians. Final results will be shared with participating communities, and in open-access journals and other scientific fora.

"33441366","Protocol for a qualitative study to identify strategies to optimise hospital ePrescribing systems.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Electronic prescribing (ePrescribing) is a key area of development and investment in the UK and across the developed world. ePrescribing is widely understood as a vehicle for tackling medication-related safety concerns, improving care quality and making more efficient use of health resources. Nevertheless, implementation of an electronic health record does not itself ensure benefits for prescribing are maximised. We examine the process of optimisation of ePrescribing systems using case studies to provide policy recommendations based on the experiences of digitally mature hospital sites.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>Qualitative interviews within six digitally mature sites will be carried out. The aim is to capture successful optimisation of electronic prescribing (ePrescribing) in particular health systems and hospitals. We have identified hospital sites in the UK and in three other developed countries. We used a combination of literature reviews and advice from experts at Optimising ePrescribing in Hospitals (eP Opt) Project round-table events. Sites were purposively selected based on geographical area, innovative work in ePrescribing/electronic health (eHealth) and potential transferability of practices to the UK setting.

"34192711","A United States Rectal Cancer Consortium Study of Inferior Mesenteric Artery versus Superior Rectal Artery Ligation: How High Do We Need to Go?","<h4>Background</h4>The optimal level of pedicle ligation during proctectomy for rectal cancer, either at the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery or the superior rectal artery, is still debated.<h4>Objective</h4>The objective was to determine if superior rectal artery ligation portends equivalent technical or oncologic outcomes.<h4>Design</h4>This was a retrospective analysis of a rectal cancer database (2007-2017).<h4>Settings</h4>The study was conducted at six tertiary referral centers in the United States (Emory University, University of Michigan, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis).<h4>Patients</h4>Patients with primary, non-metastatic rectal cancer who underwent low anterior resection or abdominoperineal resection were included.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>Anastomotic leak, lymph node harvest, locoregional recurrence-free survival, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival were measured.<h4>Results</h4>Of 877 patients, 86% (n=755) received an inferior mesenteric artery ligation while 14% (n=122) received a superior rectal artery ligation. 12%, 33%, 24%, and 31% were pathologic stage 0, I, II, and III, respectively. Median follow-up was 31 months. Superior rectal artery ligation was associated with a similar anastomotic leak rate compared to inferior mesenteric artery ligation (9vs8%, p=1.0). Median number of lymph nodes removed was identical (15vs15, p=0.38). On multivariable analysis accounting for relevant clinicopathologic factors, superior rectal artery ligation was not associated with increased anastomotic leak rate, worse lymph node harvest, or worse locoregional recurrence-free survival, recurrence-free survival, or overall survival (all p>0.1).<h4>Limitations</h4>This was a retrospective design.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Compared to inferior mesenteric artery ligation, superior rectal artery ligation is not associated with either worse technical or oncologic outcomes. Given the potential risks of inadequate blood flow to the proximal limb of the anastomosis and autonomic nerve injury, we advocate for increased utilization of superior rectal artery ligation.

"33438548","Texture Analysis in the Evaluation of Covid-19 Pneumonia in Chest X-Ray Images: a Proof of Concept Study.","<h4>Background</h4>One of the most challenging aspects related to Covid-19 is to establish the presence of infection in early phase of the disease. Texture analysis might be an additional tool for the evaluation of Chest X-ray in patients with clinical suspicion of Covid-19 related pneumonia.<h4>Objective</h4>To evaluate the diagnostic performance of texture analysis and machine learning models for the diagnosis of Covid-19 interstitial pneumonia in Chest X-ray images.<h4>Methods</h4>Chest X-ray images were accessed from a publicly available repository (https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database). Lung areas were manually segmented using a polygonal regions of interest covering both lung areas, using MaZda, a freely available software for texture analysis. A total of 308 features per ROI was extracted. One hundred-ten Covid-19 Chest X-ray images were selected for the final analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Six models, namely NB, GLM, DL, GBT, ANN and PLS-DA were selected and ensembled. According to Youden's index, the Covid-19 Ensemble Machine Learning Score showing the highest Area Under the Curve (0.971¬±0.015) was 132.57. Assuming this cut-off the Ensemble model performance was estimated evaluating both true and false positive/negative, resulting in 91.8% accuracy with 93% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Moving the cut-off value to -100, although the accuracy resulted lower (90.6%), the Ensemble Machine Learning showed 100% sensitivity, with 80% specificity.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Texture analysis of Chest X-ray images and machine learning algorithms may help in differentiating patients with Covid-19 pneumonia. Despite several limitations, this study can lay ground for future researches in this field and help developing more rapid and accurate screening tools for these patients.","https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", """", ""kaggle"", """", ""tawsifurrahman"", ""covid19"", ""radiography"", ""base"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""texture"", ""analysis"", ""in"", """", ""evaluation"", ""of"", ""covid"", ""19"", ""pneumonia"", ""chest"", ""x"", ""ray"", ""images"", ""a"", ""proof"", ""concept"", ""study"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>"", ""of"", """", """", ""chenging"", ""aspects"", ""related"", ""to"", ""covid"", ""19"", ""is"", ""establish"", ""presence"", ""infection"", ""in"", ""early"", ""pe"", ""disease"", ""texture"", ""analysis"", ""might"", ""be"", ""an"", ""additional"", """", """", ""evaluation"", ""chest"", ""x"", ""ray"", ""patients"", """", ""clinical"", ""suspicion"", ""pneumonia"", ""<h4>objective<"", ""h4>to"", ""evaluate"", ""diagnostic"", ""permance"", """", ""machine"", ""learning"", ""models"", ""diagnosis"", ""interstitial"", ""images"",

These 40 outcomes were scored for importance in two rounds of an online Delphi survey (n = 79), with 18 people attending the consensus meeting. Consensus was reached on 12 core outcomes: therapeutic misconception; comfort with decision; authenticity of decision; communication about the trial; empowerment; sense of altruism; equipoise; knowledge; salience of questions; understanding, how helpful the process was for decision making; and trial attrition.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The ELICIT core outcome set is the first internationally agreed minimum set of outcomes deemed essential to be measured in all future studies evaluating interventions to improve decisions about participating in an randomized controlled trial.

"33656920","Human Colonization with Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase-Producing <i>E. coli</i> in Relation to Animal and Environmental Exposures in Bangladesh: An Observational One Health Study.","<h4>Background</h4>Human exposure to intensively farmed livestock is a potential risk for transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) but few studies have assessed the relative role of animal vs. environmental sources of ARB in low-resource community settings.<h4>Objectives</h4>We conducted an observational study to compare ARB colonization and antibiotic-resistant gene prevalence and abundance in humans with high or low exposure to poultry in rural households, commercial poultry farms, and urban markets in Bangladesh.<h4>Methods</h4>Extended-spectrum Œ≤-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and carbapenem-resistant <i>E. coli</i> were quantified in feces from adults with high or low poultry exposure (n=100, respectively), poultry (n=200), drinking water (n=120), and wastewater (n=120) from 40 rural households, 40 poultry farms, and 40 urban markets.<h4>Results</h4>ESBL-producing <i>E. coli</i> (ESBL-EC) prevalence was 67.5% (95% CI: 61.0, 74.0) in samples from adults, 68.0% (95% CI: 61.5, 74.5) in samples from poultry, and 92.5% (95% CI: 87.7, 97.3) in wastewater samples. Carbapenem-resistant <i>E. coli</i> prevalence was high in market wastewaters [30% (95% CI: 15.0, 45.0)] but low in humans (1%) and poultry (1%). Human, poultry, and wastewater isolates shared common resistance genes: blaCTX-M-1, <i>qnr</i>, and blaTEM. Human colonization was not significantly associated with exposure to poultry or setting (rural, farm, or market). Ninety-five percent of commercial poultry farms routinely administered antibiotics. Susceptibility tests were significantly different in household vs. farm and market poultry isolates for four of seven antibiotic classes. In human isolates, there were no differences except aminoglycoside resistance (16.4% high vs. 4.4% low exposure, p=0.02). Urban market wastewaters and poultry samples had significantly higher concentrations of ESBL-EC (p<0.001) and blaCTX-M-1 (p<0.001) compared with samples from farms and rural households.<h4>Discussion</h4>ESBL-EC colonization was high in humans but not significantly associated with exposure to poultry. Bidirectional transmission of antibiotic resistance is likely between humans, poultry, and the environment in these community settings, underlining the importance of One Health mitigation strategies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7670.","https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7670.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""doi"", """", ""10"", ""1289"", ""ehp7670"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""human"", ""colonization"", """", ""extended"", ""spectrum"", ""beta"", ""lactamase"", ""producing"", ""<i>e"", ""coli<"", ""i>"", ""in"", ""relation"", ""to"", ""animal"", """", ""environmental"", ""exposures"", ""bangladesh"", ""an"", ""observational"", """", ""health"", ""study"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>human"", ""exposure"", ""to"", ""intensively"", ""farmed"", ""livestock"", ""is"", ""a"", ""potential"", ""risk"", """", ""transmission"", ""of"", ""antibiotic"", ""resistant"", ""bacteria"", ""arb"", ""but"", ""few"", ""studies"", """", ""assessed"", """", ""relative"", ""role"", ""animal"", ""vs"", ""environmental"", ""sces"", ""in"", ""low"", ""resce"", ""munity"", ""tings"", ""<h4>objectives<"", ""h4>we"", ""conducted"", ""an"", ""observational"", ""study"", ""p"", ""colonization"", """", """", ""prevalence"", ""abundance"",

"34165340","Application of Text Mining in Risk Assessment of Chemical Mixtures: A Case Study of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs).","<h4>Background</h4>Cancer risk assessment of complex exposures, such as exposure to mixtures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), is challenging due to the diverse biological activities of these compounds. With the help of text mining (TM), we have developed TM tools-the latest iteration of the Cancer Risk Assessment using Biomedical literature tool (CRAB3) and a Cancer Hallmarks Analytics Tool (CHAT)-that could be useful for automatic literature analyses in cancer risk assessment and research. Although CRAB3 analyses are based on carcinogenic modes of action (MOAs) and cover almost all the key characteristics of carcinogens, CHAT evaluates literature according to the hallmarks of cancer referring to the alterations in cellular behavior that characterize the cancer cell.<h4>Objectives</h4>The objective was to evaluate the usefulness of these tools to support cancer risk assessment by performing a case study of 22 European Union and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs and diesel exhaust and a case study of PAH interactions with silica.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed PubMed literature, comprising 57,498 references concerning priority PAHs and complex PAH mixtures, using CRAB3 and CHAT.<h4>Results</h4>CRAB3 analyses correctly identified similarities and differences in genotoxic and nongenotoxic MOAs of the 22 priority PAHs and grouped them according to their known carcinogenic potential. CHAT had the same capacity and complemented the CRAB output when comparing, for example, benzo[<i>a</i>]pyrene and dibenzo[<i>a,l</i>]pyrene. Both CRAB3 and CHAT analyses highlighted potentially interacting mechanisms within and across complex PAH mixtures and mechanisms of possible importance for interactions with silica.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These data suggest that our TM approach can be useful in the hazard identification of PAHs and mixtures including PAHs. The tools can assist in grouping chemicals and identifying similarities and differences in carcinogenic MOAs and their interactions. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6702.","https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6702.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""doi"", """", ""10"", ""1289"", ""ehp6702"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""application"", ""of"", ""text"", ""mining"", ""in"", ""risk"", ""assessment"", ""chemical"", ""mixtures"", ""a"", ""case"", ""study"", ""polycyclic"", ""aromatic"", ""hydrocarbons"", ""pahs"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>cer"", ""risk"", ""assessment"", ""of"", ""plex"", ""exposures"", """", ""as"", ""exposure"", ""to"", ""mixtures"", ""polycyclic"", ""aromatic"", ""hydrocarbons"", ""pahs"", ""is"", ""chenging"", ""due"", """", ""diverse"", ""biological"", ""activities"", ""se"", ""pounds"", """", ""help"", ""text"", ""mining"", ""tm"", ""we"", """", ""developed"", ""s"", ""latest"", ""iteration"", ""cer"", ""using"", ""biomedical"", ""literature"", """", ""crab3"", """", ""a"", ""hmarks"", ""analytics"", ""chat"", """", ""could"",

"33903179","Effectiveness of intravenous r-tPA versus UK for acute ischaemic stroke: a nationwide prospective Chinese registry study.","<h4>Background</h4>Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) and urokinase (UK) are both recommended for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) in China, but with few comparative outcome data being available. We aimed to compare the outcomes of these two thrombolytic agents for the treatment of patients within 4.5‚Äâhours of onset of AIS in routine clinical practice in China.<h4>Methods</h4>A pre-planned, prospective, nationwide, multicentre, real-world registry of consecutive patients with AIS (age ‚â•18 years) who received r-tPA or UK within 4.5‚Äâhours of symptom onset according to local decision-making and guideline recommendations during 2017-2019. The primary effectiveness outcome was the proportion of patients with an excellent functional outcome (defined by modified Rankin scale scores 0 to 1) at 90 days. The key safety endpoint was symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage according to standard definitions. Multivariable logistic regression was used for comparative analysis, with adjustment according to propensity scores to ensure balance in baseline characteristics.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, 4130 patients with AIS were registered but 320 had incomplete or missing data, leaving 3810 with available data for analysis of whom 2666 received r-tPA (median dose 0.88 (IQR 0.78-0.90)‚Äâmg/kg) and 1144 received UK (1.71 (1.43-2.00)√ó10<sup>4</sup> international unit per kilogram). There were several significant intergroup differences in patient characteristics: r-tPA patients were more educated, had less history of stroke, lower systolic blood pressure, greater neurological impairment and shorter treatment times from symptom onset than UK patients. However, in adjusted analysis, the frequency of excellent outcome (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.40, p=0.052) and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (OR 0.70, 95%‚ÄâCI 0.33 to 1.47, p=0.344) were similar between groups.<h4>Conclusions</h4>UK may be as effective and carry a similar safety profile as r-tPA in treating mild to moderate AIS within guidelines in China.

"34096110","'What matters to you?'-a qualitative study on the views of nursing home residents with dementia regarding the health care they receive.","<h4>Aims and objective</h4>This study's aim is to examine what matters to nursing home residents with dementia by exploring their perceptions of nursing home health care through the conceptual lens of person-centred care.<h4>Background</h4>Dementia is a major contributor to nursing home placement. To understand the meaning of living with dementia, the inclusion of persons with dementia in research studies is essential.<h4>Methods</h4>In total, 35 in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with people who have dementia and live in nursing homes. A thematic analysis was applied to analyse the data. Checklist for qualitative studies: Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/coreq/ RESULTS: The analysis revealed one overarching theme with four sub-themes. Different matchings of person-centred care and routines in health care being the overarching theme. The four sub-themes were as follows: (a) understanding of the interplay between disabilities and ageing; (b) participating based on one's own preferences and needs; (c) incongruence between the person with dementia's preferences and needs and health-care support; and (d) working conditions: the relationship between residents and health-care providers. Despite the substantive focus of researchers on person-centred care and the positive impact on the nursing home health care of those who receive it, the results showed that nursing home residents still want more person-centred care.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results indicate that the incongruence between general routines and individual preferences and needs, as well as the demand to operationalise the person-centred dimensions of health-care behaviour in nursing homes, must be resolved. Health care in nursing homes must focus on enabling residents to participate in daily activities and sustain their personhood and sense of self.<h4>Relevance to clinical practice</h4>Based on the residents' statements, the results contribute to the fields of dementia education, health-care provision and policy-making and may be used to achieve person-centredness and governance.","https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/coreq/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", """", ""equator"", ""nerk"", """", ""reporting"", ""guidelines"", ""coreq"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""what"", ""matters"", ""to"", ""you"", ""a"", ""qualitative"", ""study"", ""on"", """", ""views"", ""of"", ""nursing"", ""home"", ""residents"", """", ""dementia"", ""regarding"", ""health"", ""c"", ""y"", ""receive"")","c(""<h4>aims"", """", ""objective<"", ""h4>"", ""study"", ""s"", ""aim"", ""is"", ""to"", ""examine"", ""what"", ""matters"", ""nursing"", ""home"", ""residents"", """", ""dementia"", ""by"", ""exploring"", ""ir"", ""perceptions"", ""of"", ""health"", ""c"", ""through"", """", ""conceptual"", ""lens"", ""person"", ""centred"", ""<h4>background<"", ""h4>dementia"", ""a"", ""major"", ""contributor"", ""placement"", ""underst"", ""meaning"", ""living"", ""inclusion"", ""persons"", ""in"", ""research"", ""studies"", ""essential"", ""<h4>methods<"", ""h4>in"", ""total"", ""35"",

"34210730","Health literacy among pregnant women in a lifestyle intervention trial: protocol for an explorative study on the role of health literacy in the perinatal health service setting.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Pregnancy is a vulnerable period that affects long-term health of pregnant women and their unborn infants. Health literacy plays a crucial role in promoting healthy behaviour and thereby maintaining good health. This study explores the role of health literacy in the GeMuKi (acronym for 'Gemeinsam Gesund: Vorsorge plus f√ºr Mutter und Kind'-Strengthening health promotion: enhanced check-up visits for mother and child) Project. It will assess the ability of the GeMuKi lifestyle intervention to positively affect health literacy levels through active participation in preventive counselling. The study also explores associations between health literacy, health outcomes, health service use and effectiveness of the intervention.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>The GeMuKi trial has a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design and is carried out in routine prenatal health service settings in Germany. Women (n=1860) are recruited by their gynaecologist during routine check-up visits before 12 weeks of gestation. Trained healthcare providers carry out counselling using motivational interviewing techniques to positively affect health literacy and lifestyle-related risk factors. Healthcare providers (gynaecologists and midwives) and women jointly agree on Specific, Measurable, Achievable Reasonable, Time-Bound goals. Women will be invited to fill in questionnaires at two time points (at recruitment and 37th-40th week of gestation) using an app. Health literacy is measured using the German version of the Health Literacy Survey-16 and the Brief Health Literacy Screener. Lifestyle is measured with questions on physical activity, nutrition, alcohol and drug use. Health outcomes of both mother and child, including gestational weight gain (GWG) will be documented at each routine visit. Health service use will be assessed using social health insurance claims data. Data analyses will be conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 26.0. These include descriptive statistics, tests and regression models. A mediation model will be conducted to answer the question whether health behaviour mediates the association between health literacy and GWG.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>The study was approved by the University Hospital of Cologne Research Ethics Committee (ID: 18-163) and the State Chamber of Physicians in Baden-Wuerttemberg (ID: B-F-2018-100). Study results will be disseminated through (poster) presentations at conferences, publications in peer-reviewed journals and press releases.<h4>Trail registration</h4>German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00013173).

"34034357","Talking about post-injury sexual functioning: The views of people with spinal cord injuries-A qualitative interview study.","<h4>Aim</h4>This study aimed to explore perceptions of people with spinal cord injuries regarding the information they received during their rehabilitation programme on post-injury sexual functioning.<h4>Background</h4>Spinal cord injury is a traumatic, life-altering event that is associated with loss of motor and sensory function and sexual impairment. Existing evidence suggests that sexual issues are poorly handled during the rehabilitation phase of the patient's journey.<h4>Design</h4>A descriptive qualitative design was utilized in this study.<h4>Methods</h4>Twenty-nine people with spinal cord injury participated in qualitative in-depth interviews between November 2017 and April 2018, and data were analysed using the Burnard (1991, https://doi.org/10.1016/0260-6917(91)90009-y) thematic analysis framework.<h4>Results</h4>Some participants indicated they were sexually inactive prior to their spinal cord injury. They testified that they had not received information on post-injury sexual functioning. Many participants who received post-injury information on sexual functioning reported dissatisfaction with the content and timing of this information.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Personal conversations between spinal cord injured patients and dedicated members of the interdisciplinary health team can enhance the quality of rehabilitation care and patients' satisfaction with rehabilitation care.

"32299846","Pilot Study of Return of Genetic Results to Patients in Adult Nephrology.","<h4>Background and objectives</h4>Actionable genetic findings have implications for care of patients with kidney disease, and genetic testing is an emerging tool in nephrology practice. However, there are scarce data regarding best practices for return of results and clinical application of actionable genetic findings for kidney patients.<h4>Design, setting, participants, & measurements</h4>We developed a return of results workflow in collaborations with clinicians for the retrospective recontact of adult nephrology patients who had been recruited into a biobank research study for exome sequencing and were identified to have medically actionable genetic findings.<h4>Results</h4>Using this workflow, we attempted to recontact a diverse pilot cohort of 104 nephrology research participants with actionable genetic findings, encompassing 34 different monogenic etiologies of nephropathy and five single-gene disorders recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics for return as medically actionable secondary findings. We successfully recontacted 64 (62%) participants and returned results to 41 (39%) individuals. In each case, the genetic diagnosis had meaningful implications for the patients' nephrology care. Through implementation efforts and qualitative interviews with providers, we identified over 20 key challenges associated with returning results to study participants, and found that physician knowledge gaps in genomics was a recurrent theme. We iteratively addressed these challenges to yield an optimized workflow, which included standardized consultation notes with tailored management recommendations, monthly educational conferences on core topics in genomics, and a curated list of expert clinicians for patients requiring extranephrologic referrals.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Developing the infrastructure to support return of genetic results in nephrology was resource-intensive, but presented potential opportunities for improving patient care.<h4>Podcast</h4>This article contains a podcast at https://www.asn-online.org/media/podcast/CJASN/2020_04_16_12481019.mp3.","https://www.asn-online.org/media/podcast/CJASN/2020_04_16_12481019.mp3.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", """", ""asn"", ""online"", """", ""media"", ""podcast"", ""cjasn"", ""2020"", ""04"", ""16"", ""12481019"", ""mp3"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""pilot"", ""study"", ""of"", ""return"", ""tic"", ""results"", ""to"", ""patients"", ""in"", ""adult"", ""nephrology"")","c(""<h4>background"", """", ""objectives<"", ""h4>actionable"", ""tic"", ""findings"", """", ""implications"", """", ""c"", ""of"", ""patients"", """", ""kidney"", ""disease"", ""testing"", ""is"", ""an"", ""emerging"", """", ""in"", ""nephrology"", ""practice"", ""however"", ""re"", """", ""scarce"", """", ""regarding"", ""best"", ""practices"", ""return"", ""results"", ""clinical"", ""application"", ""actionable"", ""<h4>design"", ""ting"", ""participants"", ""measurements<"", ""h4>we"", ""developed"", ""a"", ""workflow"", ""collaborations"", ""clinicians"",

"33395075","Development and Validation of an Automatic Image-Recognition Endoscopic Report Generation System: A Multicenter Study.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Conventional gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy reports written by physicians are time consuming and might have obvious heterogeneity or omissions, impairing the efficiency and multicenter consultation potential. We aimed to develop and validate an image recognition-based structured report generation system (ISRGS) through a multicenter database and to assess its diagnostic performance.<h4>Methods</h4>First, we developed and evaluated an ISRGS combining real-time video capture, site identification, lesion detection, subcharacteristics analysis, and structured report generation. White light and chromoendoscopy images from patients with GI lesions were eligible for study inclusion. A total of 46,987 images from 9 tertiary hospitals were used to train, validate, and multicenter test (6:2:2). Moreover, 5,699 images were prospectively enrolled from Qilu Hospital of Shandong University to further assess the system in a prospective test set. The primary outcome was the diagnosis performance of GI lesions in multicenter and prospective tests.<h4>Results</h4>The overall accuracy in identifying early esophageal cancer, early gastric cancer, early colorectal cancer, esophageal varices, reflux esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, chronic atrophic gastritis, gastric ulcer, colorectal polyp, and ulcerative colitis was 0.8841 (95% confidence interval, 0.8775-0.8904) and 0.8965 (0.8883-0.9041) in multicenter and prospective tests, respectively. The accuracy of cecum and upper GI site identification were 0.9978 (0.9969-0.9984) and 0.8513 (0.8399-0.8620), respectively. The accuracy of staining discrimination was 0.9489 (0.9396-0.9568). The relative error of size measurement was 4.04% (range 0.75%-7.39%).<h4>Discussion</h4>ISRGS is a reliable computer-aided endoscopic report generation system that might assist endoscopists working at various hospital levels to generate standardized and accurate endoscopy reports (http://links.lww.com/CTG/A485).","http://links.lww.com/CTG/A485).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""links"", ""lww"", """", ""ctg"", ""a485"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""development"", """", ""validation"", ""of"", ""an"", ""automatic"", ""image"", ""recognition"", ""endoscopic"", ""report"", ""ration"", ""system"", ""a"", ""multicenter"", ""study"")","c(""<h4>introduction<"", ""h4>conventional"", ""gastrointestinal"", ""gi"", ""endoscopy"", ""reports"", ""written"", ""by"", ""physicians"", """", """", ""consuming"", """", ""might"", """", ""obvious"", ""heteroity"", ""or"", ""omissions"", ""impairing"", """", ""efficiency"", ""multicenter"", ""consultation"", ""potential"", ""we"", ""aimed"", ""to"", ""develop"", ""validate"", ""an"", ""image"", ""recognition"", ""based"", ""structured"", ""report"", ""ration"", ""system"", ""isrgs"", ""through"", ""a"", ""base"", ""assess"", """", ""diagnostic"", ""permance"",

"32022785","Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Asparaginase: Intra-individual Variability and Predictivity in Children With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treated With PEG-Asparaginase in the AIEOP-BFM Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 2009 Study.","<h4>Background</h4>Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) can identify patients with subtherapeutic asparaginase (ASNase) activity [silent inactivation (SI)] and prospectively guide therapeutic adaptation. However, limited intra-individual variability is a precondition for targeted dosing and the diagnosis of SI.<h4>Methods</h4>In the AIEOP-BFM acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 2009 trial, 2771 children with ALL were included and underwent ASNase-TDM in a central laboratory in M√ºnster. Two biweekly administrations of pegylated ASNase during induction and a third dose during reinduction or the high-risk block, which was administered several weeks later, were monitored. We calculated (1) the incidence of SI; and (2) the predictivity of SI for SI after the subsequent administration. ASNase activities monitored during induction were categorized into percentiles at the respective sampling time points. These percentiles were used to calculate the intra-individual range of percentiles as a surrogate for intrapatient variability and to evaluate the predictivity of ASNase activity for the subsequent administration.<h4>Results</h4>The overall incidence of SI was low (4.9%). The positive predictive value of SI identified by one sample was ‚â§21%. Confirmation of SI by a second sample indicated a high positive predictive value of 100% for biweekly administrations, but not for administration more than 17 weeks later. Sampling and/or documentation errors were risks for misdiagnosis of SI. High intra-individual variability in ASNase activities, with ranges of percentiles over more than 2 quartiles and low predictivity, was observed in approximately 25% of the patients. These patients were likely to fail dose individualization based on TDM data.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To use TDM as a basis for clinical decisions, standardized clinical procedures are required and high intra-individual variability should be taken into account.

"33963730","Correlates of serum IGF-1 in young children with moderate acute malnutrition: a cross-sectional study in Burkina Faso.","<h4>Background</h4>Serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (sIGF-1) is an important growth factor in childhood. However, studies on sIGF-1 among children from low-income countries are few, and the role of body composition is unknown.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the associations of anthropometry, body composition, inflammation, and breastfeeding with sIGF-1 among children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM).<h4>Methods</h4>A cross-sectional study based on admission data from 6- to 23-mo-old children with MAM participating in a nutrition intervention trial (Treatfood) in Burkina Faso. Linear regression analysis was used to identify correlates of sIGF-1.<h4>Results</h4>Among 1546 children, the median (IQR) sIGF-1 was 12 (8.2-18.3) ng/mL. sIGF-1 was highest at 6 mo, with a nadir ‚àº10-11 mo, and higher in girls than boys. Length-for-age z score (LAZ), weight-for-length z score (WLZ), and midupper arm circumference were positively associated with sIGF-1 (P ‚â§ 0.001). Fat-free mass (FFM) was also positively associated, as sIGF-1 increased 1.5 (95% CI: 0.5, 2.5) ng/mL for each 1-kg increase in FFM. However, the association disappeared after adjustment for height. Elevated serum C-reactive protein and Œ±1-acid glycoprotein were negatively associated with sIGF-1 (P ‚â§ 0.001), as was fever (P < 0.001) but not a positive malaria test per se (P = 0.15). Children never breastfed had lower sIGF-1 (-5.1; 95% CI: -9.8, -0.3).<h4>Conclusions</h4>LAZ and WLZ were positively and inflammation negatively associated with sIGF-1. As all children were moderately malnourished and many had inflammation, this probably explains the very low median sIGF-1. The association of FFM with sIGF-1 was fully explained by height. There was a marked age pattern, with a nadir in late infancy, confirming findings from smaller studies from well-nourished populations. There is a need for prospective studies to disentangle the role of sIGF-1 in growth and health.

"32626907","Comments on a recent case-control study of malignant mesothelioma of the pericardium and the tunica vaginalis testis.","As the first case-control study of malignant mesothelioma of the pericardium and the tunica vaginalis testis (mTVT), the paper by Marinaccio et al (1) is potentially an important epidemiologic contribution. A careful review of the paper, however, raises a number of methodological issues. Any case-control study can be viewed as being nested within a conceptual cohort, with controls being sampled from the at-risk cohort as cases arise over time. This view of case-control studies leads to the concept of incidence-density sampling of controls (eg, 2, 3). For Marinaccio et al (1) this would mean that, as cases were registered over the study period, each would be matched to an individual control or set of controls of the same gender, age, and region of the country (since asbestos exposure varies by time and region [4]). For example, if a case were 50 years old in 1995, then any matched control should be close to age 50 in 1995 and of the same gender and from the same region as the case. Matching for age in this fashion automatically results in matching for year of birth, which is essential in this context because birth-cohort effects are determinants of asbestos exposure and mesothelioma incidence (eg, 5-8). If Marinaccio et al (1) used this scheme for age-matching, one would expect to see similar distributions of cases (table 1) and controls (table S3 in the supplemental material) by period of birth. Among males, however, the distributions of mesothelioma cases (whether pericardial or mTVT) and controls by period of birth are clearly different (P<0.001). Among females, the distributions of cases of pericardial mesothelioma and controls by birth year are less dissimilar (P‚âà0.05). Thus, the female cases of pericardial mesothelioma are better matched to controls on year of birth than are male cases of either mTVT or pericardial mesothelioma. We note also that the distributions of male and female controls by year of birth are distinctly different (P<0.002), whereas the birth-year distributions of cases of mesothelioma by site and gender are not (P‚âà0.8). In the Marinaccio et al (1) sensitivity analysis restricted to subjects born before 1950, the distributions of cases and controls by period of birth remain significantly different. Therefore, based on the reported evidence, cases and controls were not matched on birth cohort, thereby possibly biasing the results. Similarly, bias may result from the lack of matching on geographic region; while cases were registered from across Italy, controls were selected from only six regions. Although a sensitivity analysis restricted cases and controls to those from only the six regions, a comparison of tables S1 and S3 indicates that the regional distribution of controls is different from that of person-time observed; that is, the controls do not appear to be representative of the underlying population at risk by region. The second major issue of concern has to do with ascertainment of asbestos exposure. Information on exposure for the cases was presumably obtained at the time of registration. The two sets of controls, obtained from previously unpublished case-control studies, were interviewed during 2014-2015 and 2014-2016; that is, many years after the exposure for most cases was ascertained (1993-2015). Few other details of the control groups are provided, except that participation by one set of controls was <50%, raising additional concerns about selection bias. For details on the second set of controls, Marinaccio et al (1) reference a paper by Brandi et al (9). On review of that paper, however, we found no description of the control group, only references to three earlier papers. Marinaccio et al (1) present analyses only with both sets of controls combined; to evaluate potential sources of bias from the use of different sets of controls, they should also report results using each set of controls separately. The authors also did not detail their methods of exposure classification. For example, what does probable or possible exposure mean? The authors should at least present separate analyses of definite occupational exposure. Eighty cases of mTVT were registered, but only 68 were included in the analyses. Information on the 12 omitted cases (eg, age, year of birth, and region) would be helpful. Marinaccio et al (1) did not provide clear information on what occupations and/or industries they considered as exposed to asbestos. In an earlier study, Marinaccio et al (10) remarked on the absence of pericardial mesothelioma and mTVT in industries with the highest exposures to asbestos, saying, ""[t]he absence of exposures in the shipbuilding, railway and asbestos-cement industries ‚Ä¶ for all the 67 pericardial and testicular cases is noteworthy but not easy to interpret."" By contrast, Marinaccio et al (1) stated, ""[t]he economic sectors more frequently associated with asbestos exposure were construction, steel mills, metal-working industry, textile industry and agriculture."" The possibility of exposure in the ""agriculture economic sector"" was not mentioned in Marinaccio et al (10) and appears not to have been considered in previous epidemiologic studies in Italy. In general, epidemiologic studies indicate that farmers and agricultural workers are not at increased risk of developing mesothelioma (eg, 11-17). The fact that few, if any, cases of mTVT and pericardial mesothelioma occurred in industries traditionally associated with high asbestos exposure raises the possibility that the results of Marinaccio et al (1) are attributable to deficiencies in study design, very possibly bias in the selection of controls, and deficiencies in exposure assessment and classification as described above, leading to a spurious association of occupational exposure with mTVT and male pericardial mesothelioma.

"33906374","Genetic Causes of Cardiomyopathy in Children: First Results From the Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Genes Study.","Background Pediatric cardiomyopathy is a genetically heterogeneous disease with substantial morbidity and mortality. Current guidelines recommend genetic testing in children with hypertrophic, dilated, or restrictive cardiomyopathy, but practice variations exist. Robust data on clinical testing practices and diagnostic yield in children are lacking. This study aimed to identify the genetic causes of cardiomyopathy in children and to investigate clinical genetic testing practices. Methods and Results Children with familial or idiopathic cardiomyopathy were enrolled from 14 institutions in North America. Probands underwent exome sequencing. Rare sequence variants in 37 known cardiomyopathy genes were assessed for pathogenicity using consensus clinical interpretation guidelines. Of the 152 enrolled probands, 41% had a family history of cardiomyopathy. Of 81 (53%) who had undergone clinical genetic testing for cardiomyopathy before enrollment, 39 (48%) had a positive result. Genetic testing rates varied from 0% to 97% between sites. A positive family history and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy subtype were associated with increased likelihood of genetic testing (<i>P</i>=0.005 and <i>P</i>=0.03, respectively). A molecular cause was identified in an additional 21% of the 63 children who did not undergo clinical testing, with positive results identified in both familial and idiopathic cases and across all phenotypic subtypes. Conclusions A definitive molecular genetic diagnosis can be made in a substantial proportion of children for whom the cause and heritable nature of their cardiomyopathy was previously unknown. Practice variations in genetic testing are great and should be reduced. Improvements can be made in comprehensive cardiac screening and predictive genetic testing in first-degree relatives. Overall, our results support use of routine genetic testing in cases of both familial and idiopathic cardiomyopathy.

"33006570","Automating the Generation of Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Reports: Proof-of-Concept Study Involving Seven Hospitals in Seven Countries.","<h4>Background</h4>Reporting cumulative antimicrobial susceptibility testing data on a regular basis is crucial to inform antimicrobial resistance (AMR) action plans at local, national, and global levels. However, analyzing data and generating a report are time consuming and often require trained personnel.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to develop and test an application that can support a local hospital to analyze routinely collected electronic data independently and generate AMR surveillance reports rapidly.<h4>Methods</h4>An offline application to generate standardized AMR surveillance reports from routinely available microbiology and hospital data files was written in the R programming language (R Project for Statistical Computing). The application can be run by double clicking on the application file without any further user input. The data analysis procedure and report content were developed based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (WHO GLASS). The application was tested on Microsoft Windows 10 and 7 using open access example data sets. We then independently tested the application in seven hospitals in Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam.<h4>Results</h4>We developed the AutoMated tool for Antimicrobial resistance Surveillance System (AMASS), which can support clinical microbiology laboratories to analyze their microbiology and hospital data files (in CSV or Excel format) onsite and promptly generate AMR surveillance reports (in PDF and CSV formats). The data files could be those exported from WHONET or other laboratory information systems. The automatically generated reports contain only summary data without patient identifiers. The AMASS application is downloadable from https://www.amass.website/. The participating hospitals tested the application and deposited their AMR surveillance reports in an open access data repository.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The AMASS is a useful tool to support the generation and sharing of AMR surveillance reports.","https://www.amass.website/.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", """", ""amass"", ""site"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""automating"", """", ""ration"", ""of"", ""antimicrobial"", ""resistance"", ""surveillance"", ""reports"", ""proof"", ""concept"", ""study"", ""involving"", ""seven"", ""hospitals"", ""in"", ""countries"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>reporting"", ""cumulative"", ""antimicrobial"", ""susceptibility"", ""testing"", """", ""on"", ""a"", ""regular"", ""basis"", ""is"", ""crucial"", ""to"", ""inm"", ""resistance"", ""amr"", ""action"", ""plans"", ""at"", ""local"", ""national"", """", ""global"", ""levels"", ""however"", ""analyzing"", ""rating"", ""report"", """", """", ""consuming"", ""often"", ""require"", ""trained"", ""personnel"", ""<h4>objective<"", ""h4>"", ""study"", ""aimed"", ""develop"", ""test"", ""an"", ""application"", """", """", ""support"", ""hospital"",

"33840048","Rank-preserving biclustering algorithm: a case study on miRNA breast cancer.","Effective biomarkers aid in the early diagnosis and monitoring of breast cancer and thus play an important role in the treatment of patients suffering from the disease. Growing evidence indicates that alteration of expression levels of miRNA is one of the principal causes of cancer. We analyze breast cancer miRNA data to discover a list of biclusters as well as breast cancer miRNA biomarkers which can help to understand better this critical disease and take important clinical decisions for treatment and diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a pattern-based parallel biclustering algorithm termed Rank-Preserving Biclustering (RPBic). The key strategy is to identify rank-preserved rows under a subset of columns based on a modified version of all substrings common subsequence (ALCS) framework. To illustrate the effectiveness of the RPBic algorithm, we consider synthetic datasets and show that RPBic outperforms relevant biclustering algorithms in terms of relevance and recovery. For breast cancer data, we identify 68 biclusters and establish that they have strong clinical characteristics among the samples. The differentially co-expressed miRNAs are found to be involved in KEGG cancer related pathways. Moreover, we identify frequency-based biomarkers (hsa-miR-410, hsa-miR-483-5p) and network-based biomarkers (hsa-miR-454, hsa-miR-137) which we validate to have strong connectivity with breast cancer.

"33251154","Vaginal Microbiota and Cytokine Microenvironment in HPV Clearance/Persistence in Women Surgically Treated for Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia: An Observational Prospective Study.","High-risk human papillomaviruses (hrHPVs) are causally related to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and subsequent cervical cancer (CC). The vaginal microbiome has been suggested to play a role in the development of CC, but the effect of conservative surgical treatment on the microbiome and hrHPV elimination has not been elucidated. In this study, we aimed to characterize the vaginal microbiome and inflammatory chemokine profile in 85 women treated for CIN2-CIN3 lesions, before and after surgical CIN removal. The results showed, as expected, a high prevalence of dysbiotic microbiomes and vaginal pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CIN cohort, correlated with disease severity, at the basal level. By contrast, surgical CIN removal induced significant vaginal microbiome variations, and specific microbiome/cytokine profiles were associated with hrHPV clearance/persistence at 6-month follow-up. hrHPV-cleared patients, in fact, showed a specific increase of <i>L. crispatus</i> and decrease of dysbiosis and inflammatory cytokines compared to hrHPV-persistent patients. These data highlight the crosstalk between HPV and the local microbiome, and suggest that vaginal microbiome modulation might represent a novel approach to modifying the natural history of hrHPV-related CC.

"34009014","DNA Methylation in Babies Born to Nonsmoking Mothers Exposed to Secondhand Smoke during Pregnancy: An Epigenome-Wide Association Study.","<h4>Background</h4>Maternal smoking during pregnancy is related to altered DNA methylation in infant umbilical cord blood. The extent to which low levels of smoke exposure among nonsmoking pregnant women relates to offspring DNA methylation is unknown.<h4>Objective</h4>This study sought to evaluate relationships between maternal prenatal plasma cotinine levels and DNA methylation in umbilical cord blood in newborns using the Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip.<h4>Methods</h4>Participants from the Newborn Epigenetics Study cohort who reported not smoking during pregnancy had verified low levels of cotinine from maternal prenatal plasma (0 ng/mL to <4‚Äâng/mL), and offspring epigenetic data from umbilical cord blood were included in this study (n=79). Multivariable linear regression models were fit to the data, controlling for cell proportions, age, race, education, and parity. Estimates represent changes in response to any 1-ng/mL unit increase in exposure.<h4>Results</h4>Multivariable linear regression models yielded 29,049 CpGs that were differentially methylated in relation to increases in cotinine at a 5% false discovery rate. Top CpGs were within or near genes involved in neuronal functioning (<i>PRKG1</i>, <i>DLGAP2</i>, <i>BSG</i>), carcinogenesis (<i>FHIT</i>, <i>HSPC157</i>) and inflammation (<i>AGER</i>). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses suggest cotinine was related to methylation of gene pathways controlling neuronal signaling, metabolic regulation, cell signaling and regulation, and cancer. Further, enhancers associated with transcription start sites were enriched in altered CpGs. Using an independent sample from the same study population (n=115), bisulfite pyrosequencing was performed with infant cord blood DNA for two genes within our top 20 hits (<i>AGER</i> and <i>PRKG1</i>). Results from pyrosequencing replicated epigenome results for <i>PRKG1</i> (cg17079497, estimate=-1.09, standard error‚Äâ(SE)=0.45, p=0.018) but not for AGER (cg09199225; estimate=-0.16, SE=0.21, p=0.44).<h4>Discussion</h4>Secondhand smoke exposure among nonsmoking women may alter DNA methylation in regions involved in development, carcinogenesis, and neuronal functioning. These novel findings suggest that even low levels of smoke exposure during pregnancy may be sufficient to alter DNA methylation in distinct sites of mixed umbilical cord blood leukocytes in pathways that are known to be altered in cord blood from pregnant active smokers. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8099.","https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8099.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""doi"", """", ""10"", ""1289"", ""ehp8099"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""dna"", ""methylation"", ""in"", ""babies"", ""born"", ""to"", ""nonsmoking"", ""mors"", ""exposed"", ""secondh"", ""smoke"", ""during"", ""pregnancy"", ""an"", ""epigenome"", ""wide"", ""association"", ""study"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>matel"", ""smoking"", ""during"", ""pregnancy"", ""is"", ""related"", ""to"", ""altered"", ""dna"", ""methylation"", ""in"", ""infant"", ""umbilical"", ""cord"", ""blood"", """", ""extent"", ""which"", ""low"", ""levels"", ""of"", ""smoke"", ""exposure"", ""among"", ""nonsmoking"", ""pregnant"", ""women"", ""relates"", ""offspring"", ""unknown"", ""<h4>objective<"", ""h4>"", ""study"", ""sought"", ""evaluate"", ""relationships"", ""between"", ""matel"", ""prenatal"", ""plasma"", ""cotinine"", """", ""borns"", ""using"", ""infinium"", ""humanmethylation"",

Patients with deafness were older (mean age ¬± <i>SEM</i>: 59.2 ¬± 0.51 vs. 57.9 ¬± 0.09 years, <i>p</i> = .01), and less likely female (47.0% vs. 57.7%, <i>p</i> < .01) compared to controls. Those with deafness had more comorbidities compared to the controls (Charlson comorbidity score ‚â• 3: 31.2% vs. 27.8%, <i>p</i> < .01). Mortality was higher among deaf versus controls (3.6% vs. 2.2%; <i>p</i> < .01); this translated into higher adjusted odds of mortality (adjusted odds ratio = 1.7. [confidence interval (CI) 1.3-2.4]; <i>p</i> = .01). Deaf patients had lower odds of being discharged home compared to controls {aOR} = 0.6, (CI) 0.55-0.73]; <i>p</i> < .01. Length of stay was longer (adjusted mean difference = 1.5 days CI [0.7-2.3]; <i>p</i> < .01) and hospital charges were higher, but not significantly so (adjusted mean difference = $4,193 CI [-$1,935-$10,322]; <i>p</i> = .18) in patients with deafness. Conclusions Hospitalized nonspeaking deaf patients had higher mortality and longer hospital stays compared to those without this condition. These results suggest that specialized attention may be warranted when deaf patients are admitted to our hospitals in hopes of reducing disparities in outcomes.

"33823117","Exploring Parental Perspectives of Childhood Speech and Language Disorders Across 10 Countries: A Pilot Qualitative Study.","Purpose Although researchers have explored parental perspectives of childhood speech and language disorders, most studies have been conducted in English-speaking countries. Little is known about parental experiences across countries, where procedures of language screening and services for language disorders differ. The authors participated in the COST <sup>1</sup> Action network IS1406, ""Enhancing Children's Oral Language Skills Across Europe and Beyond,"" which provided an opportunity to conduct cross-country qualitative interviews with parents. The aim of this pilot study was to explore ways in which parents construed and described speech and language disorders across countries. Method Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with parents from 10 families in 10 different countries. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings The overall theme was ""acknowledging parental expertise."" The parents described, in detail, ways in which their children's speech and language (dis)abilities had an impact on the children's everyday life. Three subthemes were identified: impairment, disability, and changes over time. Conclusions The findings suggest that, across a range of countries, parents demonstrated contextualized understandings of their children's speech and language (dis)abilities, along with the everyday functional implications of the disorders. Hence, despite not holding professional knowledge about language disorders, the voices, views, understandings, and personal experiences of parents in relation to their child's disorder should be listened to when planning therapy services.

"33272133","Incidence and Outcome of Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: The Swiss Study on Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (Swiss SOS).","<h4>Background and purpose</h4>The purpose of this study was to assess nationwide incidence and outcomes of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). The Swiss SOS (Swiss Study on Subarachnoid Hemorrhage) was established in 2008 and offers the unique opportunity to provide this data from the point of care on a nationwide level.<h4>Methods</h4>All patients with confirmed aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage admitted between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2014, within Switzerland were recorded in a prospective registry. Incidence rates were calculated based on time-matched population data. Admission parameters and outcomes at discharge and at 1 year were recorded.<h4>Results</h4>We recorded data of 1787 consecutive patients. The incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in Switzerland was 3.7 per 100 000 persons/y. The number of female patients was 1170 (65.5%). With a follow-up rate of 91.3% at 1 year, 1042 patients (58.8%) led an independent life according to the modified Rankin Scale (0-2). About 1 in 10 patients survived in a dependent state (modified Rankin Scale, 3-5; n=185; 10.4%). Case fatality was 20.1% (n=356) at discharge and 22.1% (n=391) after 1 year.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The current incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in Switzerland is lower than expected and an indication of a global trend toward decreasing admissions for ruptured intracranial aneurysms.

"34020445","Effect on gut microbiota of a 1-y lifestyle intervention with Mediterranean diet compared with energy-reduced Mediterranean diet and physical activity promotion: PREDIMED-Plus Study.","<h4>Background</h4>The Mediterranean diet is a well-recognized healthy diet that has shown to induce positive changes in gut microbiota. Lifestyle changes such as diet along with physical activity could aid in weight loss and improve cardiovascular risk factors.<h4>Objectives</h4>To investigate the effect of an intensive lifestyle weight loss intervention on gut microbiota.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a substudy of the PREDIMED-Plus (Prevenci√≥n con Dieta Mediterr√°nea-Plus), a randomized controlled trial conducted in overweight/obese men and women (aged 55-75 y) with metabolic syndrome. The intervention group (IG) underwent an intensive weight loss lifestyle intervention based on an energy-restricted Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and physical activity promotion, and the control group (CG) underwent a non-energy-restricted MedDiet for 1 y. Anthropometric, biochemical, and gut microbial 16S rRNA sequencing data were analyzed at baseline (n = 362) and 1-y follow-up (n = 343).<h4>Results</h4>IG participants had a weight loss of 4.2 (IQR, -6.8, -2.5) kg compared with 0.2 (IQR, -2.1, 1.4) kg in the CG (P < 0.001). Reductions in BMI, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and triglycerides and an increase in HDL cholesterol were greater in IG than in CG participants (P < 0.05). We observed a decrease in Butyricicoccus, Haemophilus, Ruminiclostridium 5, and Eubacterium hallii in the IG compared with the CG. Many genera shifted in the same direction within both intervention groups, indicating an overall effect of the MedDiet. Decreases in Haemophilus, Coprococcus 3, and few other genera were associated with a decrease in adiposity parameters in both intervention groups. Changes in Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 were positively associated with changes in MedDiet adherence.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Weight loss induced by an energy-restricted MedDiet and physical activity induce changes in gut microbiota. The role of MedDiet-induced changes on the host might be via short-chain fatty acid producing bacteria, whereas with energy restriction, these changes might be modulated with other mechanisms, which need to be explored in future studies.

"30219844","TCellXTalk facilitates the detection of co-modified peptides for the study of protein post-translational modification cross-talk in T cells.","<h4>Motivation</h4>Protein function is regulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs) that may act individually or interact with others in a phenomenon termed PTM cross-talk. Multiple databases have been dedicated to PTMs, including recent initiatives oriented towards the in silico prediction of PTM interactions. The study of PTM cross-talk ultimately requires experimental evidence about whether certain PTMs coexist in a single protein molecule. However, available resources do not assist researchers in the experimental detection of co-modified peptides.<h4>Results</h4>Herein, we present TCellXTalk, a comprehensive database of phosphorylation, ubiquitination and acetylation sites in human T cells that supports the experimental detection of co-modified peptides using targeted or directed mass spectrometry. We demonstrate the efficacy of TCellXTalk and the strategy presented here in a proof of concept experiment that enabled the identification and quantification of 15 co-modified (phosphorylated and ubiquitinated) peptides from CD3 proteins of the T-cell receptor complex. To our knowledge, these are the first co-modified peptide sequences described in this widely studied cell type. Furthermore, quantitative data showed distinct dynamics for co-modified peptides upon T cell activation, demonstrating differential regulation of co-occurring PTMs in this biological context. Overall, TCellXTalk facilitates the experimental detection of co-modified peptides in human T cells and puts forward a novel and generic strategy for the study of PTM cross-talk.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>TCellXTalk is available at https://www.tcellxtalk.org.

"34175254","Robot-assisted Versus Open Radical Cystectomy in Bladder Cancer: An Economic Evaluation Alongside a Multicentre Comparative Effectiveness Study.","<h4>Background</h4>Open radical cystectomy (ORC) is regarded as the standard treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, but robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) is increasingly used in practice. A recent study showed that RARC resulted in slightly fewer minor but slightly more major complications, although the difference was not statistically significant. Some differences were found in secondary outcomes favouring either RARC or ORC. RARC use is expected to increase in coming years, which fuels the debate about whether RARC provides value for money.<h4>Objective</h4>To assess the cost-effectiveness of RARC compared to ORC in bladder cancer.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>This economic evaluation was performed alongside a prospective multicentre comparative effectiveness study. We included 348 bladder cancer patients (ORC, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ168; RARC, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ180) from 19 Dutch hospitals.<h4>Outcome measurements and statistical analysis</h4>Over 1 yr, we assessed the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from both healthcare and societal perspectives. We used single imputation nested in the bootstrap percentile method to assess missing data and uncertainty, and inverse probability of treatment weighting to control for potential bias. Deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the impact of various parameters on the cost difference.<h4>Results and limitations</h4>The mean healthcare cost per patient was ‚Ç¨17‚Äâ141 (95% confidence interval [CI] ‚Ç¨15‚Äâ791-‚Ç¨18‚Äâ720) for ORC and ‚Ç¨21‚Äâ266 (95% CI ‚Ç¨19‚Äâ163-‚Ç¨23 650) for RARC. The mean societal cost per patient was ‚Ç¨18‚Äâ926 (95% CI ‚Ç¨17‚Äâ431-‚Ç¨22‚Äâ642) for ORC and ‚Ç¨24‚Äâ896 (95% CI ‚Ç¨21‚Äâ925-‚Ç¨31‚Äâ888) for RARC. On average, RARC patients gained 0.79 QALYs (95% CI 0.74-0.85) compared to 0.81 QALYs (95% CI 0.77-0.85) for ORC patients, resulting in a mean QALY difference of -0.02 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.02). Using a cost-effectiveness threshold of ‚Ç¨80‚Äâ000, RARC was cost-effective in 0.6% and 0.2% of the replications for the healthcare and societal perspectives, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>RARC shows no difference in terms of QALYs, but is more expensive than ORC. Hence, RARC does not seem to provide value for money in comparison to ORC.<h4>Patient summary</h4>This study assessed the relation between costs and effects of robot-assisted surgery compared to open surgery for removal of the bladder in 348 Dutch patients with bladder cancer. We found that after 1 year, the two approaches were similarly effective according to a measure called quality-adjusted life years, but robot-assisted surgery was much more expensive.

We recorded presenting characteristics and outcomes (death or organ support) up to 30 days. We categorised patients as early DNACPR (before or on the day of admission) or late/no DNACPR (no DNACPR or occurring after the day of admission). We undertook descriptive analysis comparing these groups and multivariable analysis to identify independent predictors of early DNACPR.<h4>Results</h4>We excluded 1249 with missing DNACPR data, and identified 3929/12748 (31%) with an early DNACPR decision. They had higher mortality (40.7% v 13.1%) and lower use of any organ support (11.6% v 15.7%), but received a range of organ support interventions, with some being used at rates comparable to those with late or no DNACPR (e.g. non-invasive ventilation 4.4% v 3.5%). On multivariable analysis, older age (p < 0.001), active malignancy (p < 0.001), chronic lung disease (p < 0.001), limited performance status (p < 0.001), and abnormal physiological variables were associated with increased recording of early DNACPR. Asian ethnicity was associated with reduced recording of early DNACPR (p = 0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Early DNACPR decisions were associated with recognised predictors of adverse outcome, and were inversely associated with Asian ethnicity. Most people with an early DNACPR decision survived to 30 days and many received potentially life-saving interventions.<h4>Registration</h4>ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN28342533, http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN28342533.","http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN28342533.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", """", ""isrctn"", """", ""isrctn28342533"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""do"", """", ""attempt"", ""cardiopulmonary"", ""resuscitation"", ""dnacpr"", ""decisions"", ""in"", ""people"", ""admitted"", """", ""suspected"", ""covid"", ""19"", ""secondary"", ""analysis"", ""of"", """", ""priest"", ""observational"", ""cohort"", ""study"")","c(""<h4>aims<"", ""h4>we"", ""aimed"", ""to"", ""describe"", """", ""characteristics"", """", ""outes"", ""of"", ""adults"", ""admitted"", ""hospital"", """", ""suspected"", ""covid"", ""19"", ""according"", ""ir"", ""dnacpr"", ""decisions"", ""identify"", ""factors"", ""associated"", ""<h4>methods<"", ""undertook"", ""a"", ""secondary"", ""analysis"", ""13"", ""977"", ""included"", ""in"", ""pemic"", ""respiratory"", ""infection"", ""emergency"", ""system"", ""triage"", ""priest"", ""study"", ""we"", ""recorded"", ""presenting"", ""death"", ""or"", ""an"", ""support"",

"33826413","Rare, Protein-Altering Variants in <i>AS3MT</i> and Arsenic Metabolism Efficiency: A Multi-Population Association Study.","<h4>Background</h4>Common genetic variation in the arsenic methyltransferase (<i>AS3MT</i>) gene region is known to be associated with arsenic metabolism efficiency (AME), measured as the percentage of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA%) in the urine. Rare, protein-altering variants in <i>AS3MT</i> could have even larger effects on AME, but their contribution to AME has not been investigated.<h4>Objectives</h4>We estimated the impact of rare, protein-coding variation in <i>AS3MT</i> on AME using a multi-population approach to facilitate the discovery of population-specific and shared causal rare variants.<h4>Methods</h4>We generated targeted DNA sequencing data for the coding regions of <i>AS3MT</i> for three arsenic-exposed cohorts with existing data on arsenic species measured in urine: Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS, n=2,434), Strong Heart Study (SHS, n=868), and New Hampshire Skin Cancer Study (NHSCS, n=666). We assessed the collective effects of rare (allele frequency <1%), protein-altering <i>AS3MT</i> variants on DMA%, using multiple approaches, including a test of the association between rare allele carrier status (yes/no) and DMA% using linear regression (adjusted for common variants in 10q24.32 region, age, sex, and population structure).<h4>Results</h4>We identified 23 carriers of rare-protein-altering <i>AS3MT</i> variant across all cohorts (13 in HEALS and 5 in both SHS and NHSCS), including 6 carriers of predicted loss-of-function variants. DMA% was 6-10% lower in carriers compared with noncarriers in HEALS [Œ≤=-9.4 (95% CI: -13.9, -4.8)], SHS [Œ≤=-6.9 (95% CI: -13.6, -0.2)], and NHSCS [Œ≤=-8.7 (95% CI: -15.6, -2.2)]. In meta-analyses across cohorts, DMA% was 8.7% lower in carriers [Œ≤=-8.7 (95% CI: -11.9, -5.4)].<h4>Discussion</h4>Rare, protein-altering variants in <i>AS3MT</i> were associated with lower mean DMA%, an indicator of reduced AME. Although a small percentage of the population (0.5-0.7%) carry these variants, they are associated with a 6-10% decrease in DMA% that is consistent across multiple ancestral and environmental backgrounds. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8152.","https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8152.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""doi"", """", ""10"", ""1289"", ""ehp8152"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""r"", ""protein"", ""altering"", ""variants"", ""in"", ""<i>as3mt<"", ""i>"", """", ""arsenic"", ""metabolism"", ""efficiency"", ""a"", ""multi"", ""population"", ""association"", ""study"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>mon"", ""tic"", ""variation"", ""in"", """", ""arsenic"", ""methyltransferase"", ""<i>as3mt<"", ""i>"", """", ""region"", ""is"", ""known"", ""to"", ""be"", ""associated"", """", ""metabolism"", ""efficiency"", ""ame"", ""measured"", ""as"", ""percentage"", ""of"", ""dimethylarsinic"", ""acid"", ""dma"", ""urine"", ""r"", ""protein"", ""altering"", ""variants"", ""could"", """", ""even"", ""larger"", ""effects"", ""on"", ""but"", ""ir"", ""contribution"", """", """", """", ""investigated"", ""<h4>objectives<"", ""h4>we"", ""estimated"",

"33634706","Autonomic Alterations After Pulmonary Vein Isolation in the CIRCA-DOSE (Cryoballoon vs Irrigated Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation) Study.","Background The natural history of autonomic alterations following catheter ablation of drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is poorly defined, largely because of the historical reliance on non-invasive intermittent rhythm monitoring for outcome ascertainment. Methods and Results The study included 346 patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation undergoing pulmonary vein isolation using contemporary advanced-generation ablation technologies. All patients underwent insertion of a Reveal LINQ (Medtronic) implantable cardiac monitor before ablation. The implantable cardiac monitor continuously recorded physical activity, heart rate variability (measured as the SD of the average normal-to-normal), daytime heart rate, and nighttime heart rate. Longitudinal autonomic data in the 2-month period leading up to the date of ablation were compared with the period from 91 to 365 days following ablation. Following ablation there was a significant decrease in SD of the average normal-to-normal (mean difference versus baseline of 19.3 ms; range, 12.9-25.7; <i>P</i><0.0001), and significant increases in daytime and nighttime heart rates (mean difference versus baseline of 9.6 bpm; range, 7.4-11.8; <i>P</i><0.0001, and 7.4 bpm; range, 5.4-9.3; <i>P</i><0.0001, respectively). Patients free of arrhythmia recurrence had significantly faster daytime (11¬±11 versus 8¬±12 bpm, <i>P</i>=0.001) and nighttime heart rates (8¬±9 versus 6¬±8 bpm, <i>P</i>=0.049), but no difference in SD of the average normal-to-normal (<i>P</i>=0.09) compared with those with atrial fibrillation recurrence. Ablation technology and cryoablation duration did not influence these autonomic nervous system effects. Conclusions Pulmonary vein isolation results in significant sustained changes in the heart rate parameters related to autonomic function. These changes are correlated with procedural outcome and are independent of the ablation technology used.

"33728932","Metabolic Dyslipidemia and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Findings From the Look AHEAD Study.","Background Metabolic dyslipidemia (high triglyceride) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is highly prevalent in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The extent to which diabetes mellitus-related abnormalities in the triglyceride-HDL-C profile associates with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is incompletely understood. We evaluated the associations of triglyceride and HDL-C status with CVD outcomes in individuals with T2DM. Methods and Results We analyzed data from 4199 overweight/obese adults with T2DM free of CVD with available data on triglyceride and HDL-C at baseline (2001-2004) in the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) study. We used Cox proportional models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of: (1) composite CVD outcome (myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for angina, and/or death from cardiovascular causes); (2) coronary artery disease events; and (3) cerebrovascular accidents (stroke). Of the 4199 participants, 62% (n=2600) were women, with a mean age of 58 years (SD, 7), and 40% (n=1659) had metabolic dyslipidemia at baseline. Over a median follow-up of 9.5 years (interquartile range, 8.7-10.3), 500 participants experienced the composite CVD outcome, 396 experienced coronary artery disease events, and 100 experienced stroke. Low HDL-C was associated with higher hazards of the composite CVD outcome (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.12-1.64 [<i>P</i>=0.002]) and coronary artery disease events (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.18-1.81 [<i>P</i>=0.001]) but not stroke (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.90-2.11 [<i>P</i>=0.140]). Compared with patients with normal triglyceride and normal HDL, participants with metabolic dyslipidemia had higher risks of the composite CVD outcome (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.03-1.63 [<i>P</i>=0.025]) and coronary artery disease events (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.14-1.93 [<i>P</i>=0.003]) but not stroke (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.74-2.05 [<i>P</i>=0.420]). Conclusions In a large sample of overweight/obese individuals with T2DM, metabolic dyslipidemia was associated with higher risks of CVD outcomes. Our findings highlight the necessity to account for metabolic dyslipidemia in CVD risk stratification among patients with T2DM.

"33563213","lncEvo: automated identification and conservation study of long noncoding RNAs.","<h4>Background</h4>Long noncoding RNAs represent a large class of transcripts with two common features: they exceed an arbitrary length threshold of 200 nt and are assumed to not encode proteins. Although a growing body of evidence indicates that the vast majority of lncRNAs are potentially nonfunctional, hundreds of them have already been revealed to perform essential gene regulatory functions or to be linked to a number of cellular processes, including those associated with the etiology of human diseases. To better understand the biology of lncRNAs, it is essential to perform a more in-depth study of their evolution. In contrast to protein-encoding transcripts, however, they do not show the strong sequence conservation that usually results from purifying selection; therefore, software that is typically used to resolve the evolutionary relationships of protein-encoding genes and transcripts is not applicable to the study of lncRNAs.<h4>Results</h4>To tackle this issue, we developed lncEvo, a computational pipeline that consists of three modules: (1) transcriptome assembly from RNA-Seq data, (2) prediction of lncRNAs, and (3) conservation study-a genome-wide comparison of lncRNA transcriptomes between two species of interest, including search for orthologs. Importantly, one can choose to apply lncEvo solely for transcriptome assembly or lncRNA prediction, without calling the conservation-related part.<h4>Conclusions</h4>lncEvo is an all-in-one tool built with the Nextflow framework, utilizing state-of-the-art software and algorithms with customizable trade-offs between speed and sensitivity, ease of use and built-in reporting functionalities.

"33444218","Predicting dementia diagnosis from cognitive footprints in electronic health records: a case-control study protocol.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Dementia is a group of disabling disorders that can be devastating for persons living with it and for their families. Data-informed decision-making strategies to identify individuals at high risk of dementia are essential to facilitate large-scale prevention and early intervention. This population-based case-control study aims to develop and validate a clinical algorithm for predicting dementia diagnosis, based on the cognitive footprint in personal and medical history.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>We will use territory-wide electronic health records from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS) in Hong Kong between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2018. All individuals who were at least 65 years old by the end of 2018 will be identified from CDARS. A random sample of control individuals who did not receive any diagnosis of dementia will be matched with those who <i>did</i> receive such a diagnosis by age, gender and index date with 1:1 ratio. Exposure to potential protective/risk factors will be included in both conventional logistic regression and machine-learning models. Established risk factors of interest will include diabetes mellitus, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, depression, head injuries and low education. Exploratory risk factors will include vascular disease, infectious disease and medication. The prediction accuracy of several state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms will be compared.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>This study was approved by Institutional Review Board of The University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (UW 18-225). Patients' records are anonymised to protect privacy. Study results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications.

"34012710","A Comparison of Methods for Studying the Tumor Microenvironment's Spatial Heterogeneity in Digital Pathology Specimens.","<h4>Background</h4>The tumor microenvironment is highly heterogeneous, and it is understood to affect tumor progression and patient outcome. A number of studies have reported the prognostic significance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor budding in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the significance of the intratumoral heterogeneity present in the spatial distribution of these features within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) has not been previously reported. Evaluating this intratumoral heterogeneity may aid the understanding of the TIME's effect on patient prognosis as well as identify novel aggressive phenotypes which can be further investigated as potential targets for new treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, we propose and apply two spatial statistical methodologies for the evaluation of the intratumor heterogeneity present in the distribution of CD3 <sup>+</sup> and CD8 <sup>+</sup> lymphocytes and tumor buds (TB) in 232 Stage II CRC cases. Getis-Ord hotspot analysis was applied to quantify the cold and hotspots, defined as regions with a significantly low or high number of each feature of interest, respectively. A novel spatial heatmap methodology for the quantification of the cold and hotspots of each feature of interest, which took into account both the interpatient heterogeneity and the intratumor heterogeneity, was further developed.<h4>Results</h4>Resultant data from each analysis, characterizing the spatial intratumor heterogeneity of lymphocytes and TBs were used for the development of two new highly prognostic risk models.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results highlight the value of applying spatial statistics for the assessment of the intratumor heterogeneity. Both Getis-Ord hotspot and our proposed spatial heatmap analysis are broadly applicable across other tissue types as well as other features of interest.<h4>Availability</h4>The code underpinning this publication can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.17630/c2306fe9-66e2-4442-ad89-f986220053e2.","https://doi.org/10.17630/c2306fe9-66e2-4442-ad89-f986220053e2.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""doi"", """", ""10"", ""17630"", ""c2306fe9"", ""66e2"", ""4442"", ""ad89"", ""f986220053e2"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""a"", ""parison"", ""of"", ""methods"", """", ""studying"", """", ""tumor"", ""microenvironment"", ""s"", ""spatial"", ""heteroity"", ""in"", ""digital"", ""pathology"", ""specimens"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>"", ""tumor"", ""microenvironment"", ""is"", ""ly"", ""heteroous"", """", ""it"", ""understood"", ""to"", ""affect"", ""progression"", ""patient"", ""oute"", ""a"", ""number"", ""of"", ""studies"", """", ""reported"", """", ""prognostic"", ""significe"", ""infiltrating"", ""lymphocytes"", ""budding"", ""in"", ""colorectal"", ""cer"", ""crc"", ""however"", ""intratumoral"", ""heteroity"", ""present"", ""spatial"", ""distribution"", ""se"", ""features"", ""in"", ""immune"", """", """", """", """", ""previously"",

"33982946","Clinical Impact of Rectal Hyposensitivity: A Cross-Sectional Study of 2,876 Patients With Refractory Functional Constipation.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Normal bowel function requires intact sensory pathways. Diminished rectal sensation (rectal hyposensitivity [RH]) is associated with constipation, although its clinical importance remains unclear.<h4>Methods</h4>Consecutive patients (aged 18-80) attending a tertiary center (2004-2016) for investigation of refractory functional constipation (Rome IV core criteria defined, applied post hoc) were included. Patients completed a clinical symptom questionnaire and underwent anorectal physiologic investigations, including rectal sensory testing (balloon distension) to determine 3 well-established sensory thresholds. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to evaluate associations between RH, symptomology, and allied physiologic investigations.<h4>Results</h4>Of 2,876 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 722 (25%) had RH based on ‚â•1 elevated sensory thresholds (0: n = 2,154 [74.9%]; 1: n = 327 [11.4%]; 2: n = 209 [7.3%]; and 3: n = 186 [6.5%]). A linear relationship existed between increasing number of elevated sensory thresholds and constipation severity (Cleveland Clinic constipation score: mean difference per threshold [95% confidence interval] 0.69 [0.48-0.90]; P < 0.001). Several symptoms were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with RH including: infrequent defecation (odds ratio 1.29 [1.17-1.42]), painful evacuation (1.15 [1.05-1.27]), prolonged toileting (1.14 [1.05-1.24]), and digitation or enema use (1.18 [1.08-1.30]). On defecography, a ""functional"" evacuation disorder was also associated with RH (1.37 [1.25-1.50], P < 0.001), as was megarectum (2.52 [2.08-3.05], P < 0.001).<h4>Discussion</h4>RH occurs in 25% of patients with refractory functional constipation. Increased number of elevated sensory thresholds is associated with more severe constipation phenotype. These data, in the largest study to date, provide for the first time evidence to show that RH is a major pathophysiologic mechanism in constipation, with recognized clinical impact (http://links.lww.com/AJG/B765).(Equation is included in full-text article.).","http://links.lww.com/AJG/B765).(Equation",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""links"", ""lww"", """", ""ajg"", ""b765"", ""equation"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""clinical"", ""impact"", ""of"", ""rectal"", ""hyposensitivity"", ""a"", ""cross"", ""sectional"", ""study"", ""2"", ""876"", ""patients"", """", ""refractory"", ""functional"", ""constipation"")","c(""<h4>introduction<"", ""h4>normal"", ""bowel"", ""function"", ""requires"", ""intact"", ""sensory"", ""pathways"", ""diminished"", ""rectal"", ""sensation"", ""hyposensitivity"", ""rh"", ""is"", ""associated"", """", ""constipation"", ""although"", """", ""clinical"", ""importance"", ""remains"", ""unclear"", ""<h4>methods<"", ""h4>consecutive"", ""patients"", ""aged"", ""18"", ""80"", ""attending"", ""a"", ""tertiary"", ""center"", ""2004"", ""2016"", """", ""investigation"", ""of"", ""refractory"", ""functional"", ""rome"", ""iv"", ""core"", ""criteria"", ""defined"", ""applied"",

"33164522","Comprehensive Study on Molecular Supervised Learning with Graph Neural Networks.","This work considers strategies to develop accurate and reliable graph neural networks (GNNs) for molecular property predictions. Prediction performance of GNNs is highly sensitive to the change in various parameters due to the inherent challenges in molecular machine learning, such as a deficient amount of data samples and bias in data distribution. Comparative studies with well-designed experiments are thus important to clearly understand which GNNs are powerful for molecular supervised learning. Our work presents a number of ablation studies along with a guideline to train and utilize GNNs for both molecular regression and classification tasks. First, we validate that using both atomic and bond meta-information improves the prediction performance in the regression task. Second, we find that the graph isomorphism hypothesis proposed by [Xu, K.<i>; et al</i> How powerful are graph neural networks? 2018, arXiv:1810.00826. arXiv.org e-Print archive. https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00826] is valid for the regression task. Surprisingly, however, the findings above do not hold for the classification tasks. Beyond the study on model architectures, we test various regularization methods and Bayesian learning algorithms to find the best strategy to achieve a reliable classification system. We demonstrate that regularization methods penalizing predictive entropy might not give well-calibrated probability estimation, even though they work well in other domains, and Bayesian learning methods are capable of developing reliable prediction systems. Furthermore, we argue the importance of Bayesian learning in virtual screening by showing that well-calibrated probability estimation may lead to a higher success rate.","https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00826]",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""arxiv"", """", ""abs"", ""1810"", ""00826"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""prehensive"", ""study"", ""on"", ""molecular"", ""supervised"", ""learning"", """", ""graph"", ""neural"", ""nerks"")","c("""", ""work"", ""considers"", ""strategies"", ""to"", ""develop"", ""accurate"", """", ""reliable"", ""graph"", ""neural"", ""nerks"", ""gnns"", """", ""molecular"", ""property"", ""predictions"", ""prediction"", ""permance"", ""of"", ""is"", ""ly"", ""sensitive"", """", ""change"", ""in"", ""various"", ""parameters"", ""due"", ""innt"", ""chenges"", ""machine"", ""learning"", """", ""as"", ""a"", ""deficient"", ""amount"", """", ""samples"", ""bias"", ""distribution"", ""parative"", ""studies"", """", """", ""designed"", ""experiments"",

"33086240","The Caregiver Experience After Stroke in a COVID-19 Environment: A Qualitative Study in Inpatient Rehabilitation.","<h4>Background and purpose</h4>Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States. Two-thirds of stroke survivors will require caregiver assistance. Evidence suggests the mental health of caregivers is closely related to patients' health outcomes. The timing of this study intersected with the beginning of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that required strict social distancing and hospital visitor policy changes. This study aims to answer the primary research question: What is the level and nature of stress experienced by caregivers of persons with newly-acquired stroke in the inpatient rehabilitation setting and how has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the caregiver experience?<h4>Methods</h4>Recruitment occurred from a single inpatient rehabilitation facility. Participants were administered the Perceived Stress Scale and then completed qualitative semistructured interviews. The investigators used a phenomenological, iterative approach to collect and analyze qualitative data. The data were independently coded and categorized before consolidated into primary themes and subthemes.<h4>Results</h4>Eleven informal caregivers' perspectives generated 13 subthemes across 4 primary thematic categories: COVID-19 impact, concerns of the caregiver, coping strategies, and important aspects of the caregiver experience. COVID-19 social distancing necessitated new visitor policies, which presented additional challenges for caregivers.<h4>Discussion and conclusions</h4>Caregiver attendance at therapy sessions and frequent, direct communication between staff and caregivers improved caregiver readiness for family member discharge following inpatient rehabilitation. This study shared perspectives from a distinctive time during the COVID-19 pandemic. If visitation for multiple therapy sessions is prohibited, we recommend taking alternative measures to keep the caregiver involved in the plan of care.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A326).","http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A326).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""links"", ""lww"", """", ""jnpt"", ""a326"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""cgiver"", ""experience"", ""after"", ""stroke"", ""in"", ""a"", ""covid"", ""19"", ""environment"", ""qualitative"", ""study"", ""inpatient"", ""rehabilitation"")","c(""<h4>background"", """", ""purpose<"", ""h4>stroke"", ""is"", """", ""leading"", ""ca"", ""of"", ""disability"", ""in"", ""united"", ""states"", """", ""thirds"", ""stroke"", ""survivors"", """", ""require"", ""cgiver"", ""assistance"", ""evidence"", ""suggests"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""cgivers"", ""closely"", ""related"", ""to"", ""patients"", ""outes"", ""timing"", """", ""study"", ""intersected"", """", ""beginning"", ""coronavirus"", ""disease"", ""2019"", ""covid"", ""19"", ""pemic"", """", ""required"", ""strict"", ""social"", ""distancing"",

"33435732","Rationale and Design of the SAFE-PAD Study.","<h4>Background</h4>Recent evidence from randomized controlled trials has raised concerns about the long-term safety of paclitaxel-coated peripheral devices used for femoropopliteal artery revascularization. In response to a call for more real-world data on the safety of these devices, the SAFE-PAD study (Safety Assessment of Femoropopliteal Endovascular treatment with Paclitaxel-coated Devices) was designed with input from the Food and Drug Administration to provide a long-term, comprehensive evaluation of the mortality risk associated with paclitaxel-coated devices among Medicare beneficiaries.<h4>Methods and results</h4>SAFE-PAD is an observational cohort study of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries that underwent femoropopliteal artery revascularization with either a drug-coated device or nondrug-coated device from 2015 through 2018. All patients age 66 years or older who underwent revascularization will be identified using a combination of <i>International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision</i> procedural codes, Current Procedural Terminology codes, and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System C-codes. The safety end point of all-cause death will be updated semiannually and continued until the median duration of follow-up surpasses 5 years. Sub-group analyses will be conducted by device type, patient characteristics, and procedural setting. Registration: The SAFE-PAD study has been registered on URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT04496544.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The SAFE-PAD study will evaluate the long-term safety of drug-coated devices compared with nondrug-coated devices for femoropopliteal artery revascularization among a broad, real-world population of patients with peripheral artery disease.","https://www.clinicaltrials.gov;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", """", ""clinicaltrials"", ""gov"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""rationale"", """", ""design"", ""of"", """", ""safe"", ""pad"", ""study"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>recent"", ""evidence"", """", ""romized"", ""controlled"", ""trials"", """", ""raised"", ""concerns"", ""about"", """", ""long"", ""term"", ""safety"", ""of"", ""paclitaxel"", ""coated"", ""peripheral"", ""devices"", """", """", ""femoropopliteal"", ""artery"", ""revascularization"", ""in"", ""response"", ""to"", ""a"", ""c"", """", ""real"", ""world"", """", ""on"", ""se"", ""safe"", ""pad"", ""study"", ""assessment"", ""endovascular"", ""treatment"", """", """", ""designed"", ""input"", ""food"", """", """", ""administration"",

"33964537","Children's understanding of epilepsy: A qualitative study.","<h4>Purpose</h4>To use a qualitative research approach to determine children's understandings of epilepsy and their epilepsy treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>Children aged 7-16‚ÄØyears with physician-confirmed active epilepsy (i.e., having had an epileptic seizure in the past year and or currently taking antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and not known to have an intellectual disability, were invited to participate. Children had semi-structured interviews separately on two occasions. Between the first and second interviews, an observation of a routine epilepsy clinic appointment of individual children was conducted, and was then discussed during the second interview. Participatory research tools were used in both child interviews to facilitate discussions. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed, pseudonymized and entered into NVivo (version 12, QSR International). Data were analyzed using a thematic approach.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-three children of mean age 10.1‚ÄØyears (range 8-14), mean duration of epilepsy of 4.6‚ÄØyears (range 2-10) were enrolled. Twelve were 12 female; 7 had focal, 14 had generalized, and 2 had combined epilepsy; 20 were on monotherapy; and 16 had tried previous AEDs. All had an initial (first) interview; 20 were observed during a clinic appointment and had a second interview. Five broad themes emerged: understanding of epilepsy; understanding of seizures; understanding of medication; understanding of children's role in clinical appointments; influences on children's understanding. Children spoke about what epilepsy meant by describing the physical sensations of having a seizure or through the act of taking medication. Children described the role they had, or felt they should have, but reported challenges in being meaningfully involved in clinical appointments. While healthcare professionals were initial information nodes, epilepsy information from parents appeared to be more significant for children.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The perspectives of children with epilepsy are valuable for clinicians to understand; assumptions should not be made that children's views can be accessed via parents. Clinicians need to be constantly aware of children's views and ways of understanding and communicating about their epilepsy. To support this, the research - drawing on children's words, meanings, and stories - was used to inform an easily accessible, gender-neutral, animation about epilepsy that provides information about the condition, seizures, and medication (https://youtu.be/MO7xXL2ZXP8).","https://youtu.be/MO7xXL2ZXP8).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""youtu"", ""be"", ""mo7xxl2zxp8"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""children"", ""s"", ""understing"", ""of"", ""epilepsy"", ""a"", ""qualitative"", ""study"")","c(""<h4>purpose<"", ""h4>to"", """", ""a"", ""qualitative"", ""research"", ""approach"", ""to"", ""determine"", ""children"", ""s"", ""understings"", ""of"", ""epilepsy"", """", ""ir"", ""treatment"", ""<h4>methods<"", ""h4>children"", ""aged"", ""7"", ""16"", ""äøyears"", """", ""physician"", ""confirmed"", ""active"", ""i"", ""e"", ""having"", ""had"", ""an"", ""epileptic"", ""seizure"", ""in"", """", ""past"", ""year"", ""or"", ""currently"", ""taking"", ""antiepileptic"", ""s"", ""aeds"", """", ""known"", """", ""intellectual"", ""disability"", """", ""invited"",

"33064576","Triclocarban, Triclosan, Bromochlorophene, Chlorophene, and Climbazole Effects on Nuclear Receptors: An <i>in Silico</i> and <i>in Vitro</i> Study.","<h4>Background</h4>Endocrine-disrupting chemicals can interfere with hormonal homeostasis and have adverse effects for both humans and the environment. Their identification is increasingly difficult due to lack of adequate toxicological tests. This difficulty is particularly problematic for cosmetic ingredients, because <i>in vivo</i> testing is now banned completely in the European Union.<h4>Objectives</h4>The aim was to identify candidate preservatives as endocrine disruptors by <i>in silico</i> methods and to confirm endocrine receptors' activities through nuclear receptors <i>in vitro</i>.<h4>Methods</h4>We screened preservatives listed in Annex V in the European Union Regulation on cosmetic products to predict their binding to nuclear receptors using the Endocrine Disruptome and VirtualToxLab‚Ñ¢ version 5.8 <i>in silico</i> tools. Five candidate preservatives were further evaluated for androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor (ERŒ±), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and thyroid receptor (TR) agonist and antagonist activities in cell-based luciferase reporter assays <i>in vitro</i> in AR-EcoScreen, hERŒ±-HeLa-9903, MDA-kb2, and GH3.TRE-Luc cell lines. Additionally, assays to test for false positives were used (nonspecific luciferase gene induction and luciferase inhibition).<h4>Results</h4>Triclocarban had agonist activity on AR and ERŒ± at 1ŒºM and antagonist activity on GR at 5ŒºM and TR at 1ŒºM. Triclosan showed antagonist effects on AR, ERŒ±, GR at 10ŒºM and TR at 5ŒºM, and bromochlorophene at 1ŒºM (AR and TR) and at 10ŒºM (ERŒ± and GR). AR antagonist activity of chlorophene was observed [inhibitory concentration at 50% (IC<sub>50</sub>) IC50=2.4ŒºM], as for its substantial ERŒ± agonist at >5ŒºM and TR antagonist activity at 10ŒºM. Climbazole showed AR antagonist (IC50=13.6ŒºM), ERŒ± agonist at >10ŒºM, and TR antagonist activity at 10ŒºM.<h4>Discussion</h4>These data support the concerns of regulatory authorities about the endocrine-disrupting potential of preservatives. These data also define the need to further determine their effects on the endocrine system and the need to reassess the risks they pose to human health and the environment. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6596.","https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6596.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""doi"", """", ""10"", ""1289"", ""ehp6596"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""triclocarban"", ""triclosan"", ""bromochlorophene"", ""chlorophene"", """", ""climbazole"", ""effects"", ""on"", ""nuclear"", ""receptors"", ""an"", ""<i>in"", ""silico<"", ""i>"", ""vitro<"", ""study"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>endocrine"", ""disrupting"", ""chemicals"", """", ""interfere"", """", ""hormonal"", ""homeostasis"", """", """", ""adverse"", ""effects"", """", """", ""humans"", """", ""environment"", ""ir"", ""identification"", ""is"", ""increasingly"", ""difficult"", ""due"", ""to"", ""lack"", ""of"", ""adequate"", ""toxicological"", ""tests"", """", ""difficulty"", ""particularly"", ""problematic"", ""cosmetic"", ""ingredients"", ""beca"", ""<i>in"", ""vivo<"", ""i>"", ""testing"", ""now"", ""banned"", ""pletely"", ""in"", ""european"",

The candidate pathways identified from C. elegans study were also confirmed using vertebrate model, zebrafish, Danio rerio and human relevance was then inferred using Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) analysis. Prior to evaluating the toxicity, label-free Raman mapping was conducted to investigate whether or not the organisms could uptake HDPE. C. elegans transcription factor RNAi screening results showed that the nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-Œ≤) signaling pathways were significantly associated with HDPE exposure, which was also confirmed in zebrafish model. Gene-disease interaction analysis using the CTD revealed the possible human health implications of microplastics. Finally, based on this finding, related AOPs were identified from AOP Wiki (http://aopwiki.org), which are ""Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors Œ≥ inactivation leading to lung fibrosis"" and ""AFB1: Mutagenic Mode-of-Action leading to Hepatocellular Carcinoma"".

"32839519","Serum albumin as a predictor of neurological recovery after spinal cord injury: a replication study.","<h4>Study design</h4>This was a secondary analysis on an observational cohort study.<h4>Objective</h4>To determine if serum albumin significantly associates with long-term neurological outcome (i.e., 1-year post-injury) in a contemporary cohort of individuals with spinal cord injury.<h4>Setting</h4>Six rehabilitation centers across the United States.<h4>Methods</h4>A secondary analysis of neurological outcomes and serum albumin concentrations was performed on data from the Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation study. Data was accessed from the Archive of Data on Disability to Enable Policy and research (ADDEP). The primary analysis applied unbiased recursive partitioning to examine the relationship between serum albumin, injury severity, and long-term outcomes. The analysis is accessible via https://rpubs.com/AnhKhoaVo/586028 .<h4>Results</h4>Serum albumin concentration was significantly associated with lower extremity motor scores (LEMS) and American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade at admission to rehabilitation. Serum albumin concentrations alone were also significantly associated with change of LEMS and marked recovery (improvement of at least 2 AIS grades and/or recovery to walking) at 1-year post injury. However, after adjusting for admission to rehabilitation LEMS and AIS grade, serum albumin was not significant.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The current study partially confirms our previous observations that serum albumin concentrations are associated with neurological outcome after spinal cord injury. As a crude prognostic biomarker, serum albumin concentration could be useful in cases where injury severity cannot be accurately assessed.","https://rpubs.com/AnhKhoaVo/586028",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""rpubs"", """", ""anhkhoavo"", ""586028"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""serum"", ""albumin"", ""as"", ""a"", ""predictor"", ""of"", ""neurological"", ""recy"", ""after"", ""spinal"", ""cord"", ""injury"", ""replication"", ""study"")","c(""<h4>study"", ""design<"", ""h4>"", """", ""a"", ""secondary"", ""analysis"", ""on"", ""an"", ""observational"", ""cohort"", ""study"", ""<h4>objective<"", ""h4>to"", ""determine"", ""if"", ""serum"", ""albumin"", ""signifitly"", ""associates"", """", ""long"", ""term"", ""neurological"", ""oute"", ""i"", ""e"", ""1"", ""year"", ""post"", ""injury"", ""in"", ""contemporary"", ""of"", ""individuals"", ""spinal"", ""cord"", ""<h4>ting<"", ""h4>six"", ""rehabilitation"", ""centers"", ""across"", """", ""united"", ""states"", ""<h4>methods<"", ""h4>a"", ""outes"", """",

Among them, 1088 patients from two designated hospitals in Wuhan were used to develop the prognostic model, and 276 patients from three hospitals outside Wuhan were used for external validation. All patients were followed up for a maximal of 60 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19.<h4>Methods</h4>The model discrimination was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Somers' D test, and calibration was examined by the calibration plot. Decision curve analysis was conducted.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 60 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19.<h4>Results</h4>The full model included seven predictors of age, respiratory failure, white cell count, lymphocytes, platelets, D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase. The simple model contained five indicators of age, respiratory failure, coronary heart disease, renal failure and heart failure. After cross-validation, the AUC statistics based on derivation cohort were 0.96 (95% CI, 0.96 to 0.97) for the full model and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89 to 0.95) for the simple model. The AUC statistics based on the external validation cohort were 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96 to 0.98) for the full model and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.80 to 0.96) for the simple model.

"34133393","Evaluation of Bowel Function after Surgical Treatment for Intestinal Endometriosis: A Prospective Study.","<h4>Background</h4>Defecation symptoms related to intestinal deep infiltrative endometriosis are considered to be caused by anatomical and functional disorders, and are likely linked to the course of the disease and surgical treatment.<h4>Objective</h4>The primary aim of this study was to assess bowel function before and after intestinal deep infiltrative endometriosis surgery. Secondarily, we sought to correlate defecatory symptoms with preoperative risk factors.<h4>Design/settings</h4>This is a single center prospective cohort study, using the Low Anterior Resection Syndrome Score to evaluate bowel function 4 weeks before, as well as at 6 months and one year after surgery. Wilcoxon signed rank test and logistic multiple regression analyses were performed to compare preoperative and postoperative scores. For all of the comparisons, the level of significance was set at <0.05.<h4>Patients</h4>Thirty-seven adult female patients who underwent intestinal resection for deep infiltrative endometriosis between 2015 and 2017 were included.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>The primary outcome was bowel function appraisement in deep infiltrative endometriosis intestinal surgery.<h4>Results</h4>During the preoperative evaluation, 48.6% of patients reported Low Anterior Resection Syndrome Score ‚â•21. This group presented a mean score of 17.9 ¬± 13.7, with a median of 20 and a range of 5 - 30. After one year, the mean score was decreased to 9.6 ¬± 11.1, with a median of 4 and a range of 0 - 22. A significant difference was detected when comparing the post- and preoperative scores (p=0.0006). It was also reported improvements in defecatory symptoms such as reduced fecal incontinence for flatus (p= 0.004) and liquid stools (p=0.014). The clustering of stools (p=0.005) and fecal urgency (p=0.001) also improved one year after surgery. The preoperative multiple logistic regression showed that dyschezia was the only independent variable associated with bowel symptoms.<h4>Limitations</h4>Despite it is a well-documented prospective study the data presented has a relatively small population.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study provides evidence that intestinal deep infiltrative endometriosis surgery improves bowel function and has a positive impact on evacuation symptoms.

"34124628","Uncovering transmission patterns of COVID-19 outbreaks: A region-wide comprehensive retrospective study in Hong Kong.","<h4>Background</h4>Given the dynamism and heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission patterns, determining the most effective yet timely strategies for specific regions remains a severe challenge for public health decision-makers.<h4>Methods</h4>In this work, we proposed a spatiotemporal connectivity analysis method for discovering transmission patterns across geographic locations and age-groups throughout different COVID-19 outbreak phases. First, we constructed the transmission networks of the confirmed cases during different phases by considering the spatiotemporal connectivity of any two cases. Then, for each case and those cases immediately pointed from it, we characterized the corresponding cross-district/population transmission pattern by counting their district-to-district and age-to-age occurrences. By summating the cross-district/population transmission patterns of all cases during a given period, we obtained the aggregated cross-district and cross-population transmission patterns.<h4>Findings</h4>We conducted a region-wide comprehensive retrospective study in Hong Kong based on the complete data report of COVID-19 cases, covering all 18 districts between January 23, 2020, and January 8, 2021 (https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-dh-chpsebcddr-novel-infectious-agent). The spatiotemporal connectivity analysis clearly unveiled the quantitative differences among various outbreak waves in their transmission scales, durations, and patterns. Moreover, for the statistically similar waves, their cross-district/population transmission patterns could be quite different (e.g., the cross-district transmission of the fourth wave was more diverse than that of the third wave, while the transmission over age-groups of the fourth wave was more concentrated than that of the third wave). At an overall level, super-spreader individuals (highly connected cases in the transmission networks) were usually concentrated in only a few districts (2 out of 18 in our study) or age-groups (3 out of 11 in our study).<h4>Interpretation</h4>With the discovered cross-district or cross-population transmission patterns, all of the waves of COVID-19 outbreaks in Hong Kong can be systematically scrutinized. Among all districts, quite a few (e.g., the Yau Tsim Mong district) were instrumental in spreading the virus throughout the pandemic. Aside from being exceptionally densely populated, these districts were also social-economic centers. With a variety of situated public venues, such as restaurants and singing/dancing clubs, these districts played host to all kinds of social gathering events, thereby providing opportunities for widespread and rapid transmission of the virus. Thus, these districts should be given the highest priority when deploying district-specific social distancing or intervention strategies, such as lockdown and stringent mandatory coronavirus testing for identifying and obstructing the chain of transmission. We also observed that most of the reported cases and the highly connected cases were middle-aged and elderly people (40- to 69-year-olds). People in these age-groups were active in various public places and social activities, and thus had high chances of being infected by or infecting others.<h4>Funding</h4>General research fund of the Hong Kong research grants council.","https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-dh-chpsebcddr-novel-infectious-agent).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", """", ""gov"", ""hk"", ""en"", """", ""dh"", ""chpsebcddr"", ""novel"", ""infectious"", ""agent"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""uncing"", ""transmission"", ""patterns"", ""of"", ""covid"", ""19"", ""outbreaks"", ""a"", ""region"", ""wide"", ""prehensive"", ""retrospective"", ""study"", ""in"", ""hong"", ""kong"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>given"", """", ""dynamism"", """", ""heteroity"", ""of"", ""covid"", ""19"", ""transmission"", ""patterns"", ""determining"", """", ""effective"", ""yet"", ""ly"", ""strategies"", """", ""specific"", ""regions"", ""remains"", ""a"", ""severe"", ""chenge"", ""public"", ""health"", ""decision"", ""makers"", ""<h4>methods<"", ""h4>in"", """", ""work"", ""we"", ""proposed"", ""spatiotemporal"", ""connectivity"", ""analysis"", ""method"", ""discing"", ""across"", ""geographic"", ""locations"", ""age"", ""groups"", ""throughout"",

"33999180","OpenAnnotate: a web server to annotate the chromatin accessibility of genomic regions.","Chromatin accessibility, as a powerful marker of active DNA regulatory elements, provides valuable information for understanding regulatory mechanisms. The revolution in high-throughput methods has accumulated massive chromatin accessibility profiles in public repositories. Nevertheless, utilization of these data is hampered by cumbersome collection, time-consuming processing, and manual chromatin accessibility (openness) annotation of genomic regions. To fill this gap, we developed OpenAnnotate (http://health.tsinghua.edu.cn/openannotate/) as the first web server for efficiently annotating openness of massive genomic regions across various biosample types, tissues, and biological systems. In addition to the annotation resource from 2729 comprehensive profiles of 614 biosample types of human and mouse, OpenAnnotate provides user-friendly functionalities, ultra-efficient calculation, real-time browsing, intuitive visualization, and elaborate application notebooks. We show its unique advantages compared to existing databases and toolkits by effectively revealing cell type-specificity, identifying regulatory elements and 3D chromatin contacts, deciphering gene functional relationships, inferring functions of transcription factors, and unprecedentedly promoting single-cell data analyses.

SurvivalMeth is a convenient tool which collected DNA methylation profiles of 36 cancers and allowed users to query their genes of interest in different datasets for prognosis. Furthermore, SurvivalMeth not only integrated different combinations, including single DMFE, multiple DMFEs, SEs and clinical data, to perform survival analysis on preupload data but also allowed for uploading customized DNA methylation profile of DMFEs from various diseases to analyze. SurvivalMeth provided a comprehensive resource and automated analysis for prognostic DMFEs, including DMFE methylation level, correlation analysis, clinical analysis, differential analysis, DMFE annotation, survival-related detailed result and visualization of survival analysis.

Proteins of unknown function (PUFs) are interesting targets for GM crops breeding pipelines for the novelty associated with such targets and also to avoid copyright protection. One method of inferring the putative function of PUFs is by relating them to factors of interest such as abiotic stresses using orthology and co-expression networks, in a guilt-by-association manner. In this regard, we have downloaded, analyzed, and processed genomics data of 53 angiosperms, totaling 1,862,010 genes and 2,332,974 RNA. Diamond and InterproScan were used to discover 72,266 PUFs for all organisms. RNA-seq datasets related to abiotic stresses were downloaded from NCBI/GEO. The RNA-seq data was used as input to the LSTrAP software to construct co-expression networks. LSTrAP also created clusters of transcripts with correlated expression, whose members are more probably related to the molecular mechanisms associated with abiotic stresses in the plants. Orthologous groups were created (OrhtoMCL) using all 2,332,974 proteins in order to associate PUFs to abiotic stress-related clusters of co-expression and therefore infer their function in a guilt-by-association manner.

Importantly, alterations of the correlation between methylage and age (age acceleration or deceleration) have been stably associated with pathological states and occur long before clinical signs of diseases become overt, making epigenetic clocks a potentially disruptive tool in preventive, diagnostic and also in forensic applications. Nevertheless, methylage dependency from CpGs selection, mathematical modelling, tissue specificity and age range, still makes the potential of this biomarker limited.

"33972020","REP2: A Web Server to Detect Common Tandem Repeats in Protein Sequences.","Ensembles of tandem repeats (TRs) in protein sequences expand rapidly to form domains well suited for interactions with proteins. For this reason, they are relatively frequent. Some TRs have known structures and therefore it is advantageous to predict their presence in a protein sequence. However, since most TRs diverge quickly, their detection by classical sequence comparison algorithms is not very accurate. Previously, we developed a method and a web server that used curated profiles and thresholds for the detection of 11 common TRs.

"31830251","FFLtool: a web server for transcription factor and miRNA feed forward loop analysis in human.","SUMMARY:Transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are two kinds of important regulators for transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations. Understanding cross-talks between the two regulators and their targets is critical to reveal complex molecular regulatory mechanisms. Here, we developed FFLtool, a web server for detecting potential feed forward loop (FFL) of TF-miRNA-target regulation in human. In FFLtool, we integrated comprehensive regulations of TF-target and miRNA-target, and developed two functional modules: (i) The 'FFL Analysis' module can detect potential FFLs and internal regulatory networks in a user-defined gene set. FFLtool also provides three levels of evidence to illustrate the reliability for each FFL and enrichment functions for co-target genes of the same TF and miRNA; (ii) The 'Browse FFLs' module displays FFLs comprised of differentially or specifically expressed TFs and miRNAs and their target genes in cancers. FFLtool is a valuable resource for investigating gene expression regulation and mechanism study in biological processes and diseases.

The combination between local analyses and a public repository of allelic data strikes a balance between potential confidentiality issues and the need to compare results. The possibility of deploying private instances of chewie-NS facilitates the creation of nomenclature servers with a restricted user base to allow compliance with the strictest data policies. Chewie-NS allows users to easily share their own schemas and to explore publicly available schemas, including informative statistics on schemas and loci presented in interactive charts and tables. Users can retrieve all the information necessary to run a schema locally or all the alleles identified at a particular locus. The integration with the chewBBACA suite enables users to directly upload new schemas to chewie-NS, download existing schemas and synchronize local and remote schemas from chewBBACA command line version, allowing an easier integration into high-throughput analysis pipelines.

"34164647","DUI: the drug use insights web server.","<h4>Motivation</h4>Substance abuse constitutes one of the major contemporary health epidemics. Recently, the use of social media platforms has garnered interest as a novel source of data for drug addiction epidemiology. Often however, the language used in such forums comprises slang and jargon. Currently, there are no publicly available resources to automatically analyse the esoteric language-use in the social media drug-use sub-culture. This lacunae introduces critical challenges for interpreting, sensemaking and modeling of addiction epidemiology using social media.<h4>Results</h4>Drug-Use Insights (DUI) is a public and open-source web application to address the aforementioned deficiency. DUI is underlined by a hierarchical taxonomy encompassing 108 different addiction related categories consisting of over 9,000 terms, where each category encompasses a set of semantically related terms. These categories and terms were established by utilizing thematic analysis in conjunction with term embeddings generated from 7,472,545 Reddit posts made by 1,402,017 redditors. Given post(s) from social media forums such as Reddit and Twitter, DUI can be used foremost to identify constituent terms related to drug use. Furthermore, the DUI categories and integrated visualization tools can be leveraged for semantic- and exploratory analysis. To the best of our knowledge, DUI utilizes the largest number of substance use and recovery social media posts used in a study and represents the first significant online taxonomy of drug abuse terminology.<h4>Availability</h4>The DUI web server and source code are available at: http://haddock9.sfsu.edu/insight/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","http://haddock9.sfsu.edu/insight/.<h4>Supplementary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""haddock9"", ""sfsu"", ""edu"", ""insight"", ""h4"", ""supplementary"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""dui"", """", """", """", ""insights"", """", ""server"")","c(""<h4>motivation<"", ""h4>substance"", ""ab"", ""constitutes"", """", ""of"", """", ""major"", ""contemporary"", ""health"", ""epidemics"", ""recently"", """", ""social"", ""media"", ""platms"", """", ""garnered"", ""interest"", ""as"", ""a"", ""novel"", ""sce"", """", """", """", ""addiction"", ""epidemiology"", ""often"", ""however"", ""language"", """", ""in"", """", ""ums"", ""prises"", ""slang"", """", ""jargon"", ""currently"", ""re"", """", ""no"", ""publicly"", ""available"", ""resces"", ""to"", ""automaticy"", ""analyse"",

"33729791","Epigenetic Target Profiler: A Web Server to Predict Epigenetic Targets of Small Molecules.","The identification of protein targets of small molecules is essential for drug discovery. With the increasing amount of chemogenomic data in the public domain, multiple ligand-based models for target prediction have emerged. However, these models are generally biased by the number of known ligands for different targets, which involves an under-representation of epigenetic targets, and despite the increasing importance of epigenetic targets in drug discovery, there are no open tools for epigenetic target prediction. In this work, we introduce Epigenetic Target Profiler (ETP), a freely accessible and easy-to-use web application for the prediction of epigenetic targets of small molecules. For a query compound, ETP predicts its bioactivity profile over a panel of 55 different epigenetic targets. To that aim, ETP uses a consensus model based on two binary classification models for each target, relying on support vector machines and built on molecular fingerprints of different design. A distance-to-model parameter related to the reliability of the predictions is included to facilitate their interpretability and assist in the identification of small molecules with potential epigenetic activity.

"34058973","GLEANER: a web server for GermLine cycle Expression ANalysis and Epigenetic Roadmap visualization.","<h4>Background</h4>Germline cells are important carriers of genetic and epigenetic information transmitted across generations in mammals. During the mammalian germline cell development cycle (i.e., the germline cycle), cell potency changes cyclically, accompanied by dynamic transcriptional changes and epigenetic reprogramming. Recently, to understand these dynamic and regulatory mechanisms, multiomic analyses, including transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses of DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and histone modifications of germline cells, have been performed for different stages in human and mouse germline cycles. However, the long time span of the germline cycle and material scarcity of germline cells have largely limited the understanding of these dynamic characteristic changes. A tool that integrates the existing multiomics data and visualizes the overall continuous dynamic trends in the germline cycle can partially overcome such limitations.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present GLEANER, a web server for GermLine cycle Expression ANalysis and Epigenetics Roadmap visualization. GLEANER provides a comprehensive collection of the transcriptome, DNA methylome, chromatin accessibility, and H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H3K9me3 histone modification characteristics in human and mouse germline cycles. For each input gene, GLEANER shows the integrative analysis results of its transcriptional and epigenetic features, the genes with correlated transcriptional changes, and the overall continuous dynamic trends in the germline cycle. We further used two case studies to demonstrate the detailed functionality of GLEANER and highlighted that it can provide valuable clues to the epigenetic regulation mechanisms in the genetic and epigenetic information transmitted during the germline cycle.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To the best of our knowledge, GLEANER is the first web server dedicated to the analysis and visualization of multiomics data related to the mammalian germline cycle.

Protein Structure Graphs (PSGs) are computed on a single structure, whereas information on system dynamics is supplied by ENM-NMA. The approach was implemented in a webserver (webPSN), which was significantly updated herein. The webserver now handles both proteins and nucleic acids and relies on an internal upgradable database of network parameters for ions and small molecules in all PDB structures. Apart from the radical restyle of the server and some changes in the calculation setup, other major novelties concern the possibility to: a) compute the differences in nodes, links, and communication pathways between two structures (i.e. network difference) and b) infer links, hubs, communities, and metapaths from consensus networks computed on a number of structures. These new features are useful to identify commonalties and differences between two different functional states of the same system or structural-communication signatures in homologous or analogous systems.

"32421805","IRIS3: integrated cell-type-specific regulon inference server from single-cell RNA-Seq.","A group of genes controlled as a unit, usually by the same repressor or activator gene, is known as a regulon. The ability to identify active regulons within a specific cell type, i.e., cell-type-specific regulons (CTSR), provides an extraordinary opportunity to pinpoint crucial regulators and target genes responsible for complex diseases. However, the identification of CTSRs from single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data is computationally challenging. We introduce IRIS3, the first-of-its-kind web server for CTSR inference from scRNA-Seq data for human and mouse. IRIS3 is an easy-to-use server empowered by over 20 functionalities to support comprehensive interpretations and graphical visualizations of identified CTSRs. CTSR data can be used to reliably characterize and distinguish the corresponding cell type from others and can be combined with other computational or experimental analyses for biomedical studies. CTSRs can, therefore, aid in the discovery of major regulatory mechanisms and allow reliable constructions of global transcriptional regulation networks encoded in a specific cell type. The broader impact of IRIS3 includes, but is not limited to, investigation of complex diseases hierarchies and heterogeneity, causal gene regulatory network construction, and drug development.

"33098409","SolupHred: a server to predict the pH-dependent aggregation of intrinsically disordered proteins.","<h4>Summary</h4>Polypeptides are exposed to changing environmental conditions that modulate their intrinsic aggregation propensities. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) constitutively expose their aggregation determinants to the solvent, thus being especially sensitive to its fluctuations. However, solvent conditions are often disregarded in computational aggregation predictors. We recently developed a phenomenological model to predict IDPs' solubility as a function of the solution pH, which is based on the assumption that both protein lipophilicity and charge depend on this parameter. The model anticipated solubility changes in different IDPs accurately. In this application note, we present SolupHred, a web-based interface that implements the aforementioned theoretical framework into a predictive tool able to compute IDPs aggregation propensities as a function of pH. SolupHred is the first dedicated software for the prediction of pH-dependent protein aggregation.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The SolupHred web server is freely available for academic users at: https://ppmclab.pythonanywhere.com/SolupHred.

The initial release of rMAPS focused only on the most common alternative splicing event, skipped exon or exon skipping. However, there was a high demand for the analysis of other major types of alternative splicing events, especially for retained intron events since this is the most common type of alternative splicing in plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we expanded the implementation of rMAPS2 to facilitate analyses for all five major types of alternative splicing events: skipped exon, mutually exclusive exons, alternative 5' splice site, alternative 3' splice site and retained intron. In addition, by employing multi-threading, rMAPS2 has vastly improved the user experience with significant reductions in running time, ‚àº3.5 min for the analysis of all five major alternative splicing types at once.","http://rmaps.cecsresearch.org/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""rmaps"", ""cecsresearch"", """")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""rmaps2"", ""an"", ""update"", ""of"", """", """", ""map"", ""analysis"", """", ""plotting"", ""server"", """", ""altetive"", ""splicing"", ""regulation"")","c("""", ""rmaps2"", """", ""map"", ""analysis"", """", ""plotting"", ""server"", ""2"", """", ""freely"", ""available"", ""at"", """", ""rmaps"", ""cecsresearch"", """", """", ""provided"", """", ""throughput"", ""sequencing"", """", ""research"", ""munity"", """", ""curated"", ""s"", """", ""identification"", ""of"", ""binding"", ""protein"", ""sites"", ""analyzes"", ""differential"", ""altetive"", ""splicing"", ""or"", ""clip"", ""peak"", ""obtained"", """", ""like"", ""miso"", ""rmats"", ""piranha"", ""pipe"", ""paralyzer"", ""n"", ""graphicy"",

"32459325","PaCRISPR: a server for predicting and visualizing anti-CRISPR proteins.","Anti-CRISPRs are widespread amongst bacteriophage and promote bacteriophage infection by inactivating the bacterial host's CRISPR-Cas defence system. Identifying and characterizing anti-CRISPR proteins opens an avenue to explore and control CRISPR-Cas machineries for the development of new CRISPR-Cas based biotechnological and therapeutic tools. Past studies have identified anti-CRISPRs in several model phage genomes, but a challenge exists to comprehensively screen for anti-CRISPRs accurately and efficiently from genome and metagenome sequence data. Here, we have developed an ensemble learning based predictor, PaCRISPR, to accurately identify anti-CRISPRs from protein datasets derived from genome and metagenome sequencing projects. PaCRISPR employs different types of feature recognition united within an ensemble framework. Extensive cross-validation and independent tests show that PaCRISPR achieves a significantly more accurate performance compared with homology-based baseline predictors and an existing toolkit. The performance of PaCRISPR was further validated in discovering anti-CRISPRs that were not part of the training for PaCRISPR, but which were recently demonstrated to function as anti-CRISPRs for phage infections.

"33407073","SPServer: split-statistical potentials for the analysis of protein structures and protein-protein interactions.","<h4>Background</h4>Statistical potentials, also named knowledge-based potentials, are scoring functions derived from empirical data that can be used to evaluate the quality of protein folds and protein-protein interaction (PPI) structures. In previous works we decomposed the statistical potentials in different terms, named Split-Statistical Potentials, accounting for the type of amino acid pairs, their hydrophobicity, solvent accessibility and type of secondary structure. These potentials have been successfully used to identify near-native structures in protein structure prediction, rank protein docking poses, and predict PPI binding affinities.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present the SPServer, a web server that applies the Split-Statistical Potentials to analyze protein folds and protein interfaces. SPServer provides global scores as well as residue/residue-pair profiles presented as score plots and maps. This level of detail allows users to: (1) identify potentially problematic regions on protein structures; (2) identify disrupting amino acid pairs in protein interfaces; and (3) compare and analyze the quality of tertiary and quaternary structural models.<h4>Conclusions</h4>While there are many web servers that provide scoring functions to assess the quality of either protein folds or PPI structures, SPServer integrates both aspects in a unique easy-to-use web server. Moreover, the server permits to locally assess the quality of the structures and interfaces at a residue level and provides tools to compare the local assessment between structures.

"31165321","I-PINE web server: an integrative probabilistic NMR assignment system for proteins.","Various methods for understanding the structural and dynamic properties of proteins rely on the analysis of their NMR chemical shifts. These methods require the initial assignment of NMR signals to particular atoms in the sequence of the protein, a step that can be very time-consuming. The probabilistic interaction network of evidence (PINE) algorithm for automated assignment of backbone and side chain chemical shifts utilizes a Bayesian probabilistic network model that analyzes sequence data and peak lists from multiple NMR experiments.

We present a dataset integrating DNA methylome and transcriptome analyses of antenatal hypoxia affecting rat fetal and adult offspring hearts to understand hypoxia-mediated epigenomic reprogramming of the heart development. We showed that antenatal hypoxia not only induced DNA methylomic and transcriptomic changes in the fetal hearts, but also had a delayed and lasting effect on the adult offspring hearts. Of interest, antenatal hypoxia induced opposite changes in DNA methylation patterns in fetal and adult hearts, with a hypermethylation in the fetus and a hypomethylation in the adult. An extensive preprocessing, quality assessment, and downstream data analyses were performed on the genomic dataset so that the research community may take advantage of the public resource.

"33362409","Bayesian differential programming for robust systems identification under uncertainty.","This paper presents a machine learning framework for Bayesian systems identification from noisy, sparse and irregular observations of nonlinear dynamical systems. The proposed method takes advantage of recent developments in differentiable programming to propagate gradient information through ordinary differential equation solvers and perform Bayesian inference with respect to unknown model parameters using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. This allows an efficient inference of the posterior distributions over plausible models with quantified uncertainty, while the use of sparsity-promoting priors enables the discovery of interpretable and parsimonious representations for the underlying latent dynamics. A series of numerical studies is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, including nonlinear oscillators, predator-prey systems and examples from systems biology. Taken together, our findings put forth a flexible and robust workflow for data-driven model discovery under uncertainty.

"34181547","An Approach of Epistasis Detection Using Integer Linear Programming Optimizing Bayesian Network.","Proposing a more effective and accurate epistatic loci detection method in large-scale genomic data has important research significance. Bayesian network (BN) has been widely used in constructing the network of SNPs and phenotype traits and thus to mine epistatic loci. In this work, we transform the problem of learning Bayesian network into the optimization of integer linear programming (ILP). We use the algorithms of branch-and-bound and cutting planes to get the global optimal Bayesian network (ILPBN), and thus to get epistatic loci influencing specific phenotype traits. In order to handle large-scale of SNP loci and further to improve efficiency, we use the method of optimizing Markov blanket to reduce the number of candidate parent nodes for each node. In addition, we use -BIC that is suitable for processing the epistatis mining to calculate the BN score. We use four properties of BN decomposable scoring functions to further reduce the number of candidate parent sets for each node. Finally, we compare ILPBN with several popular epistasis mining algorithms by using simulated and real Age-related macular disease (AMD) dataset. Experiment results show that ILPBN has better epistasis detection accuracy, F1-score and false positive rate in premise of ensuring the efficiency.

"34039904","Low Referral Rates for Genetic Assessment of Patients with Multiple Adenomas in United Kingdom Bowel Cancer Screening Programs.","<h4>Background</h4>Approximately one in twenty cases of colorectal cancer are caused by monogenic syndromes. Published guidelines recommend that patients with ten or more adenomas be referred for genetic testing, based on evidence that colorectal cancer risk is associated with adenoma multiplicity.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this study was to determine adherence to guidelines on referral for genetic screening in patients with ten or more adenomas.<h4>Design</h4>A cross-sectional study was performed of prospectively collected data from the United Kingdom Bowel Cancer Screening Program between May 2007 and June 2018. Only histologically confirmed adenomas were included. Clinicopathological data were recorded from patient records and referrals to clinical genetics services were ascertained.<h4>Setting</h4>Data were obtained from three centers in London, United Kingdom.<h4>Patients</h4>A total of 17,450 subjects underwent colonoscopy following an abnormal fecal occult blood test.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>We quantified patients with ten or more adenomas and the proportion referred for genetic screening.<h4>Results</h4>The adenoma detection rate was 50.6% amongst 17,450 patients who underwent colonoscopy (8,831 had one or more adenomas). 347 patients (2.0%) had 10 or more adenomas. Patients with 10 or more adenomas were more likely to be male than those with less than 10 adenomas (76.9% vs. 53.4%; p<0.0001). A family history was collected in 37.8% of the multiple adenoma population. Of 347 patients with 10 or more adenomas, 28 (8.1%) were referred for genetic assessment.<h4>Limitations</h4>All three screening centers were in a single city. No genetic outcome data were available to permit analysis of actual rates of inherited cancer syndromes in this population.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this study, almost one in fifty patients had ten or more adenomas. Despite guidelines advising genetic testing in this group, referral rates are low. A referral pathway and management strategies should be established to address this patient population.

"33529731","Deep learning for the radiographic diagnosis of proximal femur fractures: Limitations and programming issues.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Radiology is one of the domains where artificial intelligence (AI) yields encouraging results, with diagnostic accuracy that approaches that of experienced radiologists and physicians. Diagnostic errors in traumatology are rare but can have serious functional consequences. Using AI as a radiological diagnostic aid may be beneficial in the emergency room. Thus, an effective, low-cost software that helps with making radiographic diagnoses would be a relevant tool for current clinical practice, although this concept has rarely been evaluated in orthopedics for proximal femur fractures (PFF). This led us to conduct a prospective study with the goals of: 1) programming deep learning software to help make the diagnosis of PFF on radiographs and 2) to evaluate its performance.<h4>Hypothesis</h4>It is possible to program an effective deep learning software to help make the diagnosis of PFF based on a limited number of radiographs.<h4>Methods</h4>Our database consisted of 1309 radiographs: 963 had a PFF, while 346 did not. The sample size was increased 8-fold (resulting in 10,472 radiographs) using a validated technique. Each radiograph was evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon using RectLabel‚Ñ¢ software (https://rectlabel.com), by differentiating between healthy and fractured zones. Fractures were classified according to the AO system. The deep learning algorithm was programmed on Tensorflow‚Ñ¢ software (Google Brain, Santa Clara, Ca, USA, tensorflow.org). In all, 9425 annotated radiographs (90%) were used for the training phase and 1074 (10%) for the test phase.<h4>Results</h4>The sensitivity of the algorithm was 61% for femoral neck fractures and 67% for trochanteric fractures. The specificity was 67% and 69%, the positive predictive value was 55% and 56%, while the negative predictive value was 74% and 78%, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results are not good enough for our algorithm to be used in current clinical practice. Programming of deep learning software with sufficient diagnostic accuracy can only be done with several tens of thousands of radiographs, or by using transfer learning.<h4>Level of evidence</h4>III; Diagnostic studies, Study of nonconsecutive patients, without consistently applied reference ""gold"" standard.","https://rectlabel.com)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""rectlabel"", """")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""deep"", ""learning"", """", """", ""radiographic"", ""diagnosis"", ""of"", ""proximal"", ""femur"", ""fractures"", ""limitations"", """", ""programming"", ""issues"")","c(""<h4>introduction<"", ""h4>radiology"", ""is"", """", ""of"", """", ""domains"", ""w"", ""artificial"", ""intelligence"", ""ai"", ""yields"", ""encaging"", ""results"", """", ""diagnostic"", ""accuracy"", """", ""approaches"", ""experienced"", ""radiologists"", """", ""physicians"", ""errors"", ""in"", ""traumatology"", """", ""r"", ""but"", """", """", ""serious"", ""functional"", ""consequences"", ""using"", ""as"", ""a"", ""radiological"", ""aid"", ""may"", ""be"", ""beneficial"", ""emergency"", ""room"", ""thus"", ""an"", ""effective"", ""low"", ""cost"",

"33051283","Gender-transformative programming with men and boys to improve sexual and reproductive health and rights: a systematic review of intervention studies.","<h4>Background</h4>Global health organisations advocate gender-transformative programming (which challenges gender inequalities) with men and boys to improve sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) for all. We systematically review evidence for this approach.<h4>Methods</h4>We previously reported an evidence-and-gap map (http://srhr.org/masculinities/wbincome/) and <i>systematic review of reviews</i> of experimental intervention studies engaging men/boys in SRHR, identified through a Campbell Collaboration published protocol (https://doi.org/10.1002/CL2.203) without language restrictions between January 2007 and July 2018. Records for the current review of intervention studies were retrieved from those systematic reviews containing one or more gender-transformative intervention studies engaging men/boys. Data were extracted for intervention studies relating to each of the World Health Organization (WHO) SRHR outcomes. Promising programming characteristics, as well as underused strategies, were analysed with reference to the WHO definition of gender-transformative programming and an established behaviour change model, the COM-B model. Risk of bias was assessed using <i>Cochrane Risk of Bias tools,</i> RoB V.2.0 and <i>Risk of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Interventions</i>.<h4>Findings</h4>From 509 eligible records, we synthesised 68 studies comprising 36 randomised controlled trials, n=56‚Äâ417 participants, and 32 quasi-experimental studies, n=25‚Äâ554 participants. Promising programming characteristics include: multicomponent activities of education, persuasion, modelling and enablement; multilevel programming that mobilises wider communities; targeting both men and women; and programmes of longer duration than three‚Äâmonths. Six of the seven interventions evaluated more than once show efficacy. However, we identified a significant risk of bias in the overall available evidence. Important gaps in evidence relate to safe abortion and SRHR during disease outbreaks.<h4>Conclusion</h4>It is widely acknowledged by global organisations that the question is no longer <i>whether</i> to include boys and men in SRHR but <i>how</i> to do so in ways that promote gender equality and health for all and are scientifically rigorous.

"33135733","Maximum likelihood reconstruction of ancestral networks by integer linear programming.","<h4>Motivation</h4>The study of the evolutionary history of biological networks enables deep functional understanding of various bio-molecular processes. Network growth models, such as the Duplication-Mutation with Complementarity (DMC) model, provide a principled approach to characterizing the evolution of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) based on duplication and divergence. Current methods for model-based ancestral network reconstruction primarily use greedy heuristics and yield sub-optimal solutions.<h4>Results</h4>We present a new Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solution for maximum likelihood reconstruction of ancestral PPI networks using the DMC model. We prove the correctness of our solution that is designed to find the optimal solution. It can also use efficient heuristics from general-purpose ILP solvers to obtain multiple optimal and near-optimal solutions that may be useful in many applications. Experiments on synthetic data show that our ILP obtains solutions with higher likelihood than those from previous methods, and is robust to noise and model mismatch. We evaluate our algorithm on two real PPI networks, with proteins from the families of bZIP transcription factors and the Commander complex. On both the networks, solutions from our ILP have higher likelihood and are in better agreement with independent biological evidence from other studies.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>A Python implementation is available at https://bitbucket.org/cdal/network-reconstruction.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","https://bitbucket.org/cdal/network-reconstruction.<h4>Supplementary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""bitbucket"", """", ""cdal"", ""nerk"", ""reconstruction"", ""h4"", ""supplementary"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""maximum"", ""likelihood"", ""reconstruction"", ""of"", ""ancestral"", ""nerks"", ""by"", ""integer"", ""linear"", ""programming"")","c(""<h4>motivation<"", ""h4>"", ""study"", ""of"", """", ""evolutionary"", ""history"", ""biological"", ""nerks"", ""enables"", ""deep"", ""functional"", ""understing"", ""various"", ""bio"", ""molecular"", ""processes"", ""nerk"", ""growth"", ""models"", """", ""as"", ""duplication"", ""mutation"", """", ""plementarity"", ""dmc"", ""model"", ""provide"", ""a"", ""principled"", ""approach"", ""to"", ""characterizing"", ""evolution"", ""protein"", ""interactions"", ""ppis"", ""based"", ""on"", """", ""divergence"", ""current"", ""methods"", """", ""ancestral"",

Angiographic and clinical outcomes were collected, including successful reperfusion (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction ‚â•2b), functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2), 90-day mortality, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage at 24 hours. Outcomes were stratified by ASPECTS scores and age.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 984 patients enrolled, 763 had available ASPECTS data. Of these patients, 57 had ASPECTS of 0 to 5 with a median age of 63 years (interquartile range, 28-100), whereas 706 patients had ASPECTS of 6 to 10 with a median age of 70 years of age (interquartile range, 19-100). Ten patients had ASPECTS of 0 to 3 and 47 patients had ASPECTS of 4 to 5 at baseline. Successful reperfusion was achieved in 85.5% (47/55) in the ASPECTS of 0 to 5 group. Functional independence was achieved in 28.8% (15/52) in the ASPECTS of 0 to 5 versus 59.7% (388/650) in the 6 to 10 group (<i>P</i><0.001). Mortality rates were 30.8% (16/52) in the ASPECTS of 0 to 5 and 13.4% (87/650) in the 6 to 10 group (<i>P</i><0.001). sICH rates were 7.0% (4/57) in the ASPECTS of 0 to 5 and 0.9% (6/682) in the 6 to 10 group (<i>P</i><0.001). No patients aged >75 years with ASPECTS of 0 to 5 (0/12) achieved functional independence versus 44.8% (13/29) of those age ‚â§65 (<i>P</i>=0.005).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Patients <65 years of age with large core infarction (ASPECTS 0-5) have better rates of functional independence and lower rates of mortality compared with patients >75 years of age.

"31012755","Integration of wheelchair service provision education: current situation, facilitators and barriers for academic rehabilitation programs worldwide.","<b>Purpose:</b> An estimated 75 million people with disabilities need wheelchairs globally, of whom 5-15% have one. Access to an appropriate wheelchair requires rehabilitation professionals trained to provide wheelchair service. One aim of the International Society of Wheelchair Professionals (ISWP) is to promote and facilitate the integration of wheelchair service provision education into academic rehabilitation programs worldwide. To inform the development of integration strategies, the purpose of this study was to develop an in-depth global portrait of the wheelchair service provision education offered in academic rehabilitation programs, the process of its integration and the associated facilitators and barriers.<b>Method:</b> Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 14 representatives from academic rehabilitation programs (i.e., occupational therapy, physical therapy, and prosthetics and orthotics) in 11 countries, including low, middle and upper resourced settings.<b>Findings:</b> Thematic data analyses identified three overarching themes. The first theme, ""impact of context"", portrays factors related to local population needs, governance and supply chain of equipment and service delivery. The second theme, ""current and planned wheelchair education"", describes the content, pedagogic approach, student evaluation and feedback process. The third theme, ""integration process"", details five states of this process.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study describes in-depth the wheelchair service provision education across academic rehabilitation programs and resource settings, illustrating the context-dependent nature of its integration. This understanding may assist the global community of educators in preparing future rehabilitation professionals to better serve wheelchair users. This work has informed the development of ISWP's Seating and Mobility Academic Resource Toolkit (http://smart.wheelchairnetwork.org/).Implications for RehabilitationThe <i>Dynamics of Context-Dependent Integration of Wheelchair Service Provision Education in Curricula</i> model, depicting the findings of this study, may help to inform key stakeholders (i.e., academic institutions, health care providers and policy makers) about potential barriers and facilitators to the implementation of adequate wheelchair service provision education in the curricula of academic rehabilitation program.Study findings may lead to creative strategies, such as the expansion of ISWP's Seating and Mobility Academic Resource Toolkit (SMART; http://smart.wheelchairnetwork.org/), that may enable academic rehabilitation programs to be a part of the solution to strengthening rehabilitation systems worldwide, through appropriately trained rehabilitation professionals in wheelchair service provision.","c(""http://smart.wheelchairnetwork.org/).Implications""","""http://smart.wheelchairnetwork.org/)",""")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""c"", """", ""smart"", ""wheelchairnerk"", """", ""implications"")","c("""", """", ""smart"", ""wheelchairnerk"", """")","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""integration"", ""of"", ""wheelchair"", ""service"", ""provision"", ""education"", ""current"", ""situation"", ""facilitators"", """", ""barriers"", """", ""academic"", ""rehabilitation"", ""programs"", ""worldwide"")","c(""<b>purpose"", ""<"", ""b>"", ""an"", ""estimated"", ""75"", ""million"", ""people"", """", ""disabilities"", ""need"", ""wheelchairs"", ""globy"", ""of"", ""whom"", ""5"", ""15"", """", """", ""access"", ""to"", ""appropriate"", ""wheelchair"", ""requires"", ""rehabilitation"", ""professionals"", ""trained"", ""provide"", ""service"", ""aim"", """", ""intetional"", ""society"", ""iswp"", ""is"", ""promote"", """", ""facilitate"", ""integration"", ""provision"", ""education"", """", ""academic"", ""programs"", ""worldwide"", ""inm"", ""development"", ""strategies"",

"32343964","Longitudinal Competence Programs for Basic Point-of-Care Ultrasound in Critical Care: A Systematic Review.","<h4>Background</h4>Competence in point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) is widely recommended by several critical care societies. Despite numerous introductory short courses, very few doctors attain PoCUS competence because of the challenges in establishing longitudinal competence programs.<h4>Research question</h4>To evaluate the methodologic quality of the literature on basic PoCUS competence processes in critical care.<h4>Study design and methods</h4>A systematic review to identify manuscripts meeting predefined inclusion criteria was performed using three medical databases (PubMed, OVID Embase, and Web of Science); using extra references from original articles, review articles, and expert panel guidelines; and by directly contacting authors for further information if required. The objectives, domains, and inclusion and exclusion criteria of the review were determined during discussions between experienced PoCUS educators. Data extraction and analyses were performed independently by three reviewers.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 5,408 abstracts extracted, 42 met the inclusion criteria for longitudinal PoCUS competence. Each study was described along four broad categories: general information, study design, and trainee characteristics; description of introductory course; description of longitudinal competence program; and grading of overall methodologic quality on a 4-point Likert scale. Thirty-nine studies (92.9%) were from a single center. Most studies lacked important details on study methodology such as prior ultrasound experience, pre- and postcourse tests, models for hands-on sessions, ratio of instructors to trainees, competence assessment criteria, number of scans performed by individual trainees, and formative and summative assessments. The studies were rated as follows: poor = 19 (45.2%), average = 15 (35.7%), good = 4 (9.5%), and excellent = 4 (9.5%).<h4>Interpretation</h4>Ther is very little high-quality evidence on PoCUS competence. To help frame policy guidelines to improve PoCUS education, there is a need for well-designed longitudinal studies on PoCUS competence.<h4>Trial registry</h4>PROSPERO database; No.: CRD42018094033; URL: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/.","https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", """", ""crd"", ""york"", ""ac"", ""uk"", ""prospero"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""longitudinal"", ""petence"", ""programs"", """", ""basic"", ""point"", ""of"", ""c"", ""ultrasound"", ""in"", ""critical"", ""a"", ""systematic"", ""review"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>petence"", ""in"", ""point"", ""of"", ""c"", ""ultrasound"", ""pocus"", ""is"", ""widely"", ""remended"", ""by"", ""several"", ""critical"", ""societies"", ""despite"", ""numerous"", ""introductory"", ""short"", ""cses"", ""very"", ""few"", ""doctors"", ""attain"", ""petence"", ""beca"", """", ""chenges"", ""establishing"", ""longitudinal"", ""programs"", ""<h4>research"", ""question<"", ""h4>to"", ""evaluate"", ""methodologic"", ""quality"", ""literature"", ""on"", ""basic"", ""processes"", ""<h4>study"", ""design"", """", ""methods<"",

"34076892","The PREPARE for Your Care program increases advance care planning engagement among diverse older adults with cancer.","<h4>Background</h4>Advance care planning (ACP) is low among older adults with cancer. In a secondary analysis of randomized trial data, the authors compared the efficacy of the PREPARE for Your Care (PREPARE) website plus an easy-to-read advance directive (AD) with an AD only among older adults with and without cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>Safety net, primary care patients in San Francisco were included if they were 55 years old or older, were English- or Spanish-speaking, and had 2 or more chronic conditions. The authors determined cancer diagnoses by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision/Tenth Revision codes. The primary outcome was new ACP documentation in the medical record at 15 months; the secondary outcomes were self-reported ACP engagement, ease of use, satisfaction, and depression/anxiety. The authors used mixed effects logistic and linear regression adjusted for prior ACP, health literacy, and clinician, including a cancer interaction term.<h4>Results</h4>Of 986 participants, 220 (22%) had cancer. The mean age was 63 years (SD, 6 years), 61% were women, 81% were of a minority race/ethnicity, 45% were Spanish-speaking, 39% had limited health literacy, and 27% had prior ACP. New ACP documentation was higher in the PREPARE arm versus the AD-only arm among participants with cancer (62% vs 43%; P = .01) and without cancer (38% vs 28%; P = .01), as was ACP engagement in both arms (P < .001), with no interactions by cancer. Ease of use and satisfaction were high, and depression/anxiety was low, with no differences by study arm or by cancer/no cancer.<h4>Conclusions</h4>PREPARE plus an easy-to-read AD increased ACP documentation and engagement among diverse older adults with cancer more than an AD alone, with no increase in depression or anxiety between study arms or by cancer. PREPARE may help to decrease ACP disparities among patients with cancer.<h4>Lay summary</h4>Advance care planning (ACP) is the process of sharing values, goals, and preferences for medical care, but engagement in ACP is low among older adults with cancer. Among 986 English- and Spanish-speaking older adults from a safety net hospital, an interactive, multimedia, web-based ACP program (PREPARE for Your Care at https://prepareforyourcare.org/) plus an easy-to-read advance directive increased ACP documentation and engagement more than an advance directive alone.

"33593821","Therapeutic Targeting of DGKA-Mediated Macropinocytosis Leads to Phospholipid Reprogramming in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.","Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a rare destructive lung disease affecting primarily women and is the primary lung manifestation of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). In lymphangioleiomyomatosis, biallelic loss of TSC1/2 leads to hyperactivation of mTORC1 and inhibition of autophagy. To determine how the metabolic vulnerabilities of TSC2-deficient cells can be targeted, we performed a high-throughput screen utilizing the ""Repurposing"" library at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard (Cambridge, MA), with or without the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine. Ritanserin, an inhibitor of diacylglycerol kinase alpha (DGKA), was identified as a selective inhibitor of proliferation of Tsc2<sup>-/-</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), with no impact on Tsc2<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs. DGKA is a lipid kinase that metabolizes diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid, a key component of plasma membranes. Phosphatidic acid levels were increased 5-fold in Tsc2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs compared with Tsc2<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs, and treatment of Tsc2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs with ritanserin led to depletion of phosphatidic acid as well as rewiring of phospholipid metabolism. Macropinocytosis is known to be upregulated in TSC2-deficient cells. Ritanserin decreased macropinocytic uptake of albumin, limited the number of lysosomes, and reduced lysosomal activity in Tsc2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs. In a mouse model of TSC, ritanserin treatment decreased cyst frequency and volume, and in a mouse model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, genetic downregulation of DGKA prevented alveolar destruction and airspace enlargement. Collectively, these data indicate that DGKA supports macropinocytosis in TSC2-deficient cells to maintain phospholipid homeostasis and promote proliferation. Targeting macropinocytosis with ritanserin may represent a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of TSC and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. SIGNIFICANCE: This study identifies macropinocytosis and phospholipid metabolism as novel mechanisms of metabolic homeostasis in mTORC1-hyperactive cells and suggest ritanserin as a novel therapeutic strategy for use in mTORC1-hyperactive tumors, including pancreatic cancer.

"34009297","powerEQTL: An R package and shiny application for sample size and power calculation of bulk tissue and single-cell eQTL analysis.","<h4>Summary</h4>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed thousands of genetic loci for common diseases. One of the main challenges in the post-GWAS era is to understand the causality of the genetic variants. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis is an effective way to address this question by examining the relationship between gene expression and genetic variation in a sufficiently powered cohort. However, it is frequently a challenge to determine the sample size at which a variant with a specific allele frequency will be detected to associate with gene expression with sufficient power. This is a particularly difficult task for single-cell RNAseq studies. Therefore, a user-friendly tool to estimate statistical power for eQTL analyses in both bulk tissue and single-cell data is needed. Here, we presented an R package called powerEQTL with flexible functions to estimate power, minimal sample size, or detectable minor allele frequency for both bulk tissue and single-cell eQTL analysis. A user-friendly, program-free web application is also provided, allowing users to calculate and visualize the parameters interactively.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The powerEQTL R package source code and online tutorial are freely available at CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/powerEQTL/.

"33901273","Protlego: A Python package for the analysis and design of chimeric proteins.","<h4>Motivation</h4>Duplication and recombination of protein fragments have led to the highly diverse protein space that we observe today. By mimicking this natural process, the design of protein chimeras via fragment recombination has proven experimentally successful and has opened a new era for the design of customizable proteins. The in-silico building of structural models for these chimeric proteins, however, remains a manual task that requires a considerable degree of expertise and is not amenable for high-throughput studies. Energetic and structural analysis of the designed proteins often require the use of several tools, each with their unique technical difficulties and available in different programming languages or web servers.<h4>Results</h4>We implemented a Python package that enables automated, high-throughput design of chimeras and their structural analysis. First, it fetches evolutionarily conserved fragments from a built-in database (also available at fuzzle.uni-bayreuth.de). These relationships can then be represented via networks or further selected for chimera construction via recombination. Designed chimeras or natural proteins are then scored and minimised with the Charmm and Amber forcefields and their diverse structural features can be analysed at ease. Here, we showcase Protlego's pipeline by exploring the relationships between the P-loop and Rossmann superfolds, building and characterising their offspring chimeras. We believe that Protlego provides a powerful new tool for the protein design community.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Protlego runs on the Linux platform and is freely available at (https://hoecker-lab.github.io/protlego/) with tutorials and documentation and runs on Linux OS.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","https://hoecker-lab.github.io/protlego/)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""hoecker"", ""lab"", ""github"", ""io"", ""protlego"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""protlego"", ""a"", ""python"", ""package"", """", """", ""analysis"", """", ""design"", ""of"", ""chimeric"", ""proteins"")","c(""<h4>motivation<"", ""h4>duplication"", """", ""rebination"", ""of"", ""protein"", ""fragments"", """", ""led"", ""to"", """", ""ly"", ""diverse"", ""space"", """", ""we"", ""observe"", ""today"", ""by"", ""mimicking"", """", ""natural"", ""process"", ""design"", ""chimeras"", ""via"", ""fragment"", """", ""proven"", ""experimenty"", ""successful"", ""opened"", ""a"", """", ""era"", """", ""customizable"", ""proteins"", ""in"", ""silico"", ""building"", ""structural"", ""models"", ""se"", ""chimeric"", ""however"", ""remains"", ""manual"", ""task"",

Computer programs that analyze NGS data obtained from a mapping population of individuals derived from a mutant of interest to identify a causal mutation are available; however, the installation and usage of such programs requires bioinformatic skills, modifying or combining pieces of existing software, or purchasing licenses. To ease this process, we developed Easymap, an open-source program that simplifies the data analysis workflows from raw NGS reads to candidate mutations. Easymap can perform bulked segregant mapping of point mutations induced by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) with DNA-seq or RNA-seq datasets, as well as tagged-sequence mapping for large insertions, such as transposons or T-DNAs. The mapping analyses implemented in Easymap have been validated with experimental and simulated datasets from different plant and animal model species. Easymap was designed to be accessible to all users regardless of their bioinformatics skills by implementing a user-friendly graphical interface, a simple universal installation script, and detailed mapping reports, including informative images and complementary data for assessment of the mapping results.

Discovering cancer-subtype-specific drugs is a crucial step in personalized medicine. SubtypeDrug is a system biology R-based software package that enables the prioritization of subtype-specific drugs based on cancer expression data from samples of many subtypes. This provides a novel approach to identify the subtype-specific drug by considering biological functions regulated by drugs at the subpathway level. The operation modes include extraction of subpathways from biological pathways, identification of dysregulated subpathways induced by each drug, inference of sample-specific subpathway activity profiles, evaluation of drug-disease reverse association at the subpathways level, identification of cancer-subtype-specific drugs through subtype sample set enrichment analysis, and visualization of the results. Its capabilities enable SubtypeDrug to find subtype-specific drugs, which will fill the gaps in the recent tools which only identify the drugs for a particular cancer type. SubtypeDrug may help to facilitate the development of tailored treatment for patients with cancer.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The package is implemented in R and available under GPL-2 license from the CRAN website (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SubtypeDrug).<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SubtypeDrug).<h4>Supplementary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""cran"", ""r"", ""project"", """", ""package"", ""subtype"", ""h4"", ""supplementary"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""subtype"", ""a"", ""softw"", ""package"", """", ""prioritization"", ""of"", ""didate"", ""cer"", ""subtype"", ""specific"", ""s"")","c(""<h4>summary<"", ""h4>cer"", """", ""be"", ""classified"", """", ""various"", ""subtypes"", ""by"", """", ""molecular"", ""histological"", ""or"", ""clinical"", ""characteristics"", ""discing"", ""cer"", ""subtype"", ""specific"", ""s"", ""is"", ""a"", ""crucial"", ""step"", ""in"", ""personalized"", ""medicine"", ""subtype"", ""system"", ""biology"", ""r"", ""based"", ""softw"", ""package"", """", ""enables"", """", ""prioritization"", ""of"", ""on"", ""expression"", """", """", ""samples"", ""many"", """", ""provides"", ""novel"", ""approach"",

"33222322","Analysis of mutational signatures with yet another package for signature analysis.","Different mutational processes leave characteristic patterns of somatic mutations in the genome that can be identified as mutational signatures. Determining the contributions of mutational signatures to cancer genomes allows not only to reconstruct the etiology of somatic mutations, but can also be used for improved tumor classification and support therapeutic decisions. We here present the R package yet another package for signature analysis (YAPSA) to deconvolute the contributions of mutational signatures to tumor genomes. YAPSA provides in-built collections from the COSMIC and PCAWG SNV signature sets as well as the PCAWG Indel signatures and employs signature-specific cutoffs to increase sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, YAPSA allows to determine 95% confidence intervals for signature exposures, to perform constrained stratified signature analyses to obtain enrichment and depletion patterns of the identified signatures and, when applied to whole exome sequencing data, to correct for the triplet content of individual target capture kits. With this functionality, YAPSA has proved to be a valuable tool for analysis of mutational signatures in molecular tumor boards in a precision oncology context.

"32696040","Metasubtract: an R-package to analytically produce leave-one-out meta-analysis GWAS summary statistics.","<h4>Summary</h4>statistics from a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (meta-GWAS) can be used for many follow-up analyses. One valuable application is the creation of polygenic scores. However, if polygenic scores are calculated in a validation cohort that was part of the meta-GWAS consortium, this cohort is not independent and analyses will therefore yield inflated results. The R package 'MetaSubtract' was developed to subtract the results of the validation cohort from meta-GWAS summary statistics analytically. The statistical formulas for a meta-analysis were inverted to compute corrected summary statistics of a meta-GWAS leaving one (or more) cohort(s) out. These formulas have been implemented in MetaSubtract for different meta-analyses methods (fixed effects inverse variance or square root sample size weighted z-score) accounting for no, single or double genomic control correction. Results obtained by MetaSubtract correlate very well to those calculated using the traditional way, i.e. by performing a meta-analysis leaving out the validation cohort. In conclusion, MetaSubtract allows researchers to compute meta-GWAS summary statistics that are independent of the GWAS results of the validation cohort without requiring access to the cohort level GWAS results of the corresponding meta-GWAS consortium.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MetaSubtract.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MetaSubtract.<h4>Supplementary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""cran"", ""r"", ""project"", """", """", ""packages"", ""metasubtract"", ""h4"", ""supplementary"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""metasubtract"", ""an"", ""r"", ""package"", ""to"", ""analyticy"", ""produce"", ""leave"", """", ""out"", ""meta"", ""analysis"", ""g"", ""summary"", ""statistics"")","c(""<h4>summary<"", ""h4>statistics"", """", ""a"", ""meta"", ""analysis"", ""of"", ""genome"", ""wide"", ""association"", ""studies"", ""g"", """", ""be"", """", """", ""many"", ""follow"", ""up"", ""analyses"", """", ""valuable"", ""application"", ""is"", """", ""creation"", ""polygenic"", ""scores"", ""however"", ""if"", """", ""calculated"", ""in"", ""validation"", ""cohort"", """", """", ""part"", ""consortium"", """", """", ""independent"", """", """", ""ree"", ""yield"", ""inflated"", ""results"", ""r"", ""package"", ""metasubtract"", ""developed"",

"32689928","SpectralTAD: an R package for defining a hierarchy of topologically associated domains using spectral clustering.","<h4>Background</h4>The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the genome plays a crucial role in gene expression regulation. Chromatin conformation capture technologies (Hi-C) have revealed that the genome is organized in a hierarchy of topologically associated domains (TADs), sub-TADs, and chromatin loops. Identifying such hierarchical structures is a critical step in understanding genome regulation. Existing tools for TAD calling are frequently sensitive to biases in Hi-C data, depend on tunable parameters, and are computationally inefficient.<h4>Methods</h4>To address these challenges, we developed a novel sliding window-based spectral clustering framework that uses gaps between consecutive eigenvectors for TAD boundary identification.<h4>Results</h4>Our method, implemented in an R package, SpectralTAD, detects hierarchical, biologically relevant TADs, has automatic parameter selection, is robust to sequencing depth, resolution, and sparsity of Hi-C data. SpectralTAD outperforms four state-of-the-art TAD callers in simulated and experimental settings. We demonstrate that TAD boundaries shared among multiple levels of the TAD hierarchy were more enriched in classical boundary marks and more conserved across cell lines and tissues. In contrast, boundaries of TADs that cannot be split into sub-TADs showed less enrichment and conservation, suggesting their more dynamic role in genome regulation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>SpectralTAD is available on Bioconductor, http://bioconductor.org/packages/SpectralTAD/ .","http://bioconductor.org/packages/SpectralTAD/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""bioconductor"", """", ""packages"", ""spectraltad"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""spectraltad"", ""an"", ""r"", ""package"", """", ""defining"", ""a"", ""hierarchy"", ""of"", ""topologicy"", ""associated"", ""domains"", ""using"", ""spectral"", ""clustering"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>"", ""three"", ""dimensional"", ""3d"", ""structure"", ""of"", """", ""genome"", ""plays"", ""a"", ""crucial"", ""role"", ""in"", """", ""expression"", ""regulation"", ""chromatin"", ""conmation"", ""capture"", ""technologies"", ""hi"", ""c"", """", ""revealed"", """", ""is"", ""anized"", ""hierarchy"", ""topologicy"", ""associated"", ""domains"", ""tads"", ""sub"", """", ""loops"", ""identifying"", """", ""hierarchical"", ""structures"", ""critical"", ""step"", ""understing"", ""existing"", ""s"", """", ""tad"", ""cing"",

However, the biological consequence of miRNA activity in the form of altered protein-coding gene (PCG) expression can be captured using machine-learning algorithms. Here, we present iMIRAGE (imputed miRNA activity from gene expression), a convenient tool to predict miRNA expression using PCG expression of the test datasets. The iMIRAGE package provides an integrated workflow for normalization and transformation of miRNA and PCG expression data, along with the option to utilize predicted miRNA targets to impute miRNA activity from independent test PCG datasets.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The iMIRAGE package for R, along with package documentation and vignette, is available at https://aritronath.github.io/iMIRAGE/index.html.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","https://aritronath.github.io/iMIRAGE/index.html.<h4>Supplementary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""aritronath"", ""github"", ""io"", ""imirage"", ""index"", ""html"", ""h4"", ""supplementary"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""imirage"", ""an"", ""r"", ""package"", ""to"", ""impute"", ""micro"", ""expression"", ""using"", ""protein"", ""coding"", ""s"")","c(""<h4>summary<"", ""h4>micros"", ""mis"", """", ""critical"", ""post"", ""transcriptional"", ""regulators"", ""of"", """", ""expression"", ""due"", ""to"", ""chenges"", ""in"", ""accurate"", ""profiling"", ""sm"", ""s"", ""a"", ""vast"", ""majority"", ""public"", ""transcriptome"", ""s"", ""lack"", ""reliable"", ""mi"", ""profiles"", ""however"", """", ""biological"", ""consequence"", ""activity"", ""m"", ""altered"", ""protein"", ""coding"", ""pcg"", """", ""be"", ""captured"", ""using"", ""machine"", ""learning"", ""algorithms"", """", ""we"",

"31821408","psSubpathway: a software package for flexible identification of phenotype-specific subpathways in cancer progression.","SUMMARY:Subpathways, which are defined as local gene subregions within a biological pathway, have been reported to be associated with the occurrence and development of cancer. The recent subpathway identification tools generally identify differentially expressed subpathways between normal and cancer samples. psSubpathway is a novel systems biology R-based software package that enables flexible identification of phenotype-specific subpathways in a cancer dataset with multiple categories (such as multiple subtypes and developmental stages of cancer). The operation modes include extraction of subpathways from pathway networks, inference with subpathway activities in the context of gene expression data, identification of subtype-specific subpathways, identification of dynamic-changed subpathways associated with the cancer developmental stage and visualization of subpathway activities of samples in different phenotypes. Its capabilities enable psSubpathway to find specific abnormal subpathways in the datasets with multi-phenotype categories and to fill the gaps in the recent tools. psSubpathway may identify more specific biomarkers to facilitate the development of tailored treatment for patients with cancer.

"33837660","Upregulation of ZHX2 predicts poor prognosis and is correlated with immune infiltration in gastric cancer.","The transcriptional repressor zinc finger homeobox 2 (ZHX2) is reported to regulate tumor progression in several human cancers, although little is known about its role in gastric cancer (GC). In the present study, we investigated the expression of ZHX2 and its relationship with the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of GC patients, and we also examined the effect of ZHX2 overexpression in GC cell lines. We used UALCAN (http://ualcan.path.uab.edu) and the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (http://cistrome.org/TIMER) to examine ZHX2 mRNA expression, and also used Kaplan-Meier Plotter (https://kmplot.com) to determine whether ZHX2 expression was related to GC prognosis. Expression of ZHX2 protein was detected using immunohistochemical staining assays. Cell proliferation was evaluated using a cell counting kit-8 and colony formation assays, whereas apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. Wound healing and transwell assays were used to detect cell migration and invasion. We also performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org) and used The Cancer Genome Atlas database (https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Cancer-Genome-Atlas) to examine the correlation of ZHX2 with immune infiltration. We report that ZHX2 is highly expressed in GC tissues and is significantly associated with clinical characteristics. Upregulation of ZHX2 predicted poor prognosis in GC. Furthermore, ZHX2 overexpression can promote the proliferation, invasion and migration, but inhibit apoptosis, of GC cells. High expression of ZHX2 in GC is correlated with the presence of infiltrating immune cells, including B cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Our data suggest that high expression of ZHX2 in GC predicts poor prognosis. In addition, ZHX2 may promote malignant behaviors of GC cells, and immune infiltration might be related to the oncogenic role of ZHX2 in GC.","c(""http://ualcan.path.uab.edu)""","""http://cistrome.org/TIMER)""","""https://kmplot.com)""","""https://www.gsea-msigdb.org)""","""https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Cancer-Genome-Atlas)"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""c"", """", ""ual"", ""path"", ""uab"", ""edu"")","c("""", """", ""cistrome"", """", ""r"")","c("""", """", ""kmplot"", """")","c("""", """", """", ""gsea"", ""msigdb"", """")","c("""", """", """", ""genome"", ""gov"", ""funded"", ""programs"", ""projects"", ""cer"", ""atlas"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""upregulation"", ""of"", ""zhx2"", ""predicts"", ""poor"", ""prognosis"", """", ""is"", ""correlated"", """", ""immune"", ""infiltration"", ""in"", ""gastric"", ""cer"")","c("""", ""transcriptional"", ""repressor"", ""zinc"", ""finger"", ""homeobox"", ""2"", ""zhx2"", ""is"", ""reported"", ""to"", ""regulate"", ""tumor"", ""progression"", ""in"", ""several"", ""human"", ""cers"", ""although"", ""little"", ""known"", ""about"", """", ""role"", ""gastric"", ""cer"", ""gc"", ""present"", ""study"", ""we"", ""investigated"", ""expression"", ""of"", """", ""relationship"", """", ""clinicopathological"", ""characteristics"", ""prognosis"", ""patients"", """", ""examined"", ""effect"", ""expression"", """", ""lines"", """", ""ual"",

The Arabidopsis mutant lacking the main photoreceptors, however, still shows clock entrainment, indicating that the integration of light into the morning transcriptome is not well understood. In this study, we performed a high-resolution RNA-sequencing time-series experiment, sampling every 2 min beginning at dawn. In parallel experiments, we perturbed temperature, the circadian clock, photoreceptor signaling, and chloroplast-derived light signaling. We used these data to infer a gene network that describes the gene expression dynamics after light stimulus in the morning, and then validated key edges. By sampling time points at high density, we are able to identify three light- and temperature-sensitive bursts of transcription factor activity, one of which lasts for only about 8 min. Phytochrome and cryptochrome mutants cause a delay in the transcriptional bursts at dawn, and completely remove a burst of expression in key photomorphogenesis genes (HY5 and BBX family). Our complete network is available online (http://www-users.york.ac.uk/‚àºde656/dawnBurst/dawnBurst.html).

High throughput RNA sequencing analyses have generated a tremendous amount of transcript sequence data. A large proportion of these transcript sequences does not code for proteins and are known as non-coding RNAs. Among them, lncRNAs are a unique class of transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides with diverse biological functions and regulatory mechanisms. Recent emerging studies and next-generation sequencing technologies show a substantial amount of lncRNAs within the plant genome, which are yet to be identified. The computational identification of lncRNAs from these transcripts is a challenging task due to the involvement of a series of filtering steps. We have developed lncRNADetector, a bioinformatics pipeline for the identification of novel lncRNAs, especially from medicinal and aromatic plant (MAP) species. The lncRNADetector has been utilized to analyse and identify more than 88,459 lncRNAs from 21 species of MAPs. To provide a knowledge resource for the plant research community towards elucidating the diversity of biological roles of lncRNAs, the information generated about MAP lncRNAs (post-filtering steps) through lncRNADetector has been stored and organized in MAPslnc database (MAPslnc, https://lncrnapipe.cimap.res.in).

"34090324","Reproducible and accessible analysis of transposon insertion sequencing in Galaxy for qualitative essentiality analyses.","<h4>Background</h4>Significant progress has been made in advancing and standardizing tools for human genomic and biomedical research. Yet, the field of next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis for microorganisms (including multiple pathogens) remains fragmented, lacks accessible and reusable tools, is hindered by local computational resource limitations, and does not offer widely accepted standards. One such ""problem areas"" is the analysis of Transposon Insertion Sequencing (TIS) data. TIS allows probing of almost the entire genome of a microorganism by introducing random insertions of transposon-derived constructs. The impact of the insertions on the survival and growth under specific conditions provides precise information about genes affecting specific phenotypic characteristics. A wide array of tools has been developed to analyze TIS data. Among the variety of options available, it is often difficult to identify which one can provide a reliable and reproducible analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Here we sought to understand the challenges and propose reliable practices for the analysis of TIS experiments. Using data from two recent TIS studies, we have developed a series of workflows that include multiple tools for data de-multiplexing, promoter sequence identification, transposon flank alignment, and read count repartition across the genome. Particular attention was paid to quality control procedures, such as determining the optimal tool parameters for the analysis and removal of contamination.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our work provides an assessment of the currently available tools for TIS data analysis. It offers ready to use workflows that can be invoked by anyone in the world using our public Galaxy platform ( https://usegalaxy.org ).

"33793824","Analysis of a photosynthetic cyanobacterium rich in internal membrane systems via gradient profiling by sequencing (Grad-seq).","Although regulatory small RNAs have been reported in photosynthetic cyanobacteria, the lack of clear RNA chaperones involved in their regulation poses a conundrum. Here, we analyzed the full complement of cellular RNAs and proteins using gradient profiling by sequencing (Grad-seq) in Synechocystis 6803. Complexes with overlapping subunits such as the CpcG1-type versus the CpcL-type phycobilisomes or the PsaK1 versus PsaK2 photosystem I pre(complexes) could be distinguished, supporting the high quality of this approach. Clustering of the in-gradient distribution profiles followed by several additional criteria yielded a short list of potential RNA chaperones that include an YlxR homolog and a cyanobacterial homolog of the KhpA/B complex. The data suggest previously undetected complexes between accessory proteins and CRISPR-Cas systems, such as a Csx1-Csm6 ribonucleolytic defense complex. Moreover, the exclusive association of either RpoZ or 6S RNA with the core RNA polymerase complex and the existence of a reservoir of inactive sigma-antisigma complexes is suggested.

To allow for comprehensive mapping, we first curated a comprehensive list of GPCRs in the genomes of mice, rats, and humans (https://hpcwebapps.cit.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/GPCRs/) using multiple online data sources. We used this list to mine segment-specific and cell type-specific expression data from RNA-sequencing studies in microdissected mouse tubule segments to identify GPCRs that are selectively expressed in discrete tubule segments. Comparisons of these mapped mouse GPCRs with other omics datasets as well as functional data from isolated perfused tubule and micropuncture studies confirmed patterns of expression for well-known receptors and identified poorly studied GPCRs that are likely to play roles in the regulation of renal tubule function.

When evaluated against a balanced independent test set derived from the NESG database, SoluProt's accuracy of 58.5% and AUC of 0.62 exceeded those of a suite of alternative solubility prediction tools.

"33877858","Developing a Flexible National Wastewater Surveillance System for COVID-19 and Beyond.","<h4>Background</h4>Wastewater testing offers a cost-effective strategy for measuring population disease prevalence and health behaviors. For COVID-19, wastewater surveillance addresses testing gaps and provides an early warning for outbreaks. As U.S. federal agencies build a National Wastewater Surveillance System around the pandemic, thinking through ways to develop flexible frameworks for wastewater sampling, testing, and reporting can avoid unnecessary system overhauls for future infectious disease, chronic disease, and drug epidemics.<h4>Objectives</h4>We discuss ways to transform a historically academic exercise into a tool for epidemic response. We generalize lessons learned by a global network of wastewater researchers around validation and implementation for COVID-19 and opioids while also drawing on our experience with wastewater-based epidemiology in the United States.<h4>Discussion</h4>Sustainable wastewater surveillance requires coordination between health and safety officials, utilities, labs, and researchers. Adapting sampling frequency, type, and location to threat level, community vulnerability, biomarker properties, and decisions that wastewater data will inform can increase the practical value of the data. Marketplace instabilities, coupled with a fragmented testing landscape due to specialization, may require officials to engage multiple labs to test for known and unknown threats. Government funding can stabilize the market, balancing commercial pressures with public good, and incentivize data sharing. When reporting results, standardizing metrics and contextualizing wastewater data with health resource data can provide insights into a community's vulnerability and identify strategies to prevent health care systems from being overwhelmed. If wastewater data will inform policy decisions for an entire community, comparing characteristics of the wastewater treatment plant's service population to those of the larger community can help determine whether the wastewater data are generalizable. Ethical protocols may be needed to protect privacy and avoid stigmatization. With data-driven approaches to sample collection, analysis, and interpretation, officials can use wastewater surveillance for adaptive resource allocation, pandemic management, and program evaluation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8572.","https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8572.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""doi"", """", ""10"", ""1289"", ""ehp8572"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""developing"", ""a"", ""flexible"", ""national"", ""tewater"", ""surveillance"", ""system"", """", ""covid"", ""19"", """", ""beyond"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>tewater"", ""testing"", ""offers"", ""a"", ""cost"", ""effective"", ""strategy"", """", ""measuring"", ""population"", ""disease"", ""prevalence"", """", ""health"", ""behaviors"", ""covid"", ""19"", ""tewater"", ""surveillance"", ""addresses"", ""gaps"", ""provides"", ""an"", ""early"", ""warning"", ""outbreaks"", ""as"", ""u"", ""s"", ""federal"", ""agencies"", ""build"", ""national"", ""system"", ""around"", """", ""pemic"", ""thinking"", ""through"", ""ways"", ""to"", ""develop"", ""flexible"", ""frameworks"", ""sampling"", ""reporting"",

"33110585","Rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic: Vietnam government's experience and preliminary success.","<h4>Background</h4>The COVID-19 pandemic has hit all corners of the world, challenging governments to act promptly in controlling the spread of the pandemic. Due to limited resources and inferior technological capacities, developing countries including Vietnam have faced many challenges in combating the pandemic. Since the first cases were detected on 23 January 2020, Vietnam has undergone a 3-month fierce battle to control the outbreak with stringent measures from the government to mitigate the adverse impacts. In this study, we aim to give insights into the Vietnamese government's progress during the first three months of the outbreak. Additionally, we relatively compare Vietnam's response with that of other Southeast Asia countries to deliver a clear and comprehensive view on disease control strategies.<h4>Methods</h4>The data on the number of COVID-19 confirmed and recovered cases in Vietnam was obtained from the Dashboard for COVID-19 statistics of the Ministry of Health (https://ncov.vncdc.gov.vn/). The review on Vietnam's country-level responses was conducted by searching for relevant government documents issued on the online database 'Vietnam Laws Repository' (https://thuvienphapluat.vn/en/index.aspx), with the grey literature on Google and relevant official websites. A stringency index of government policies and the countries' respective numbers of confirmed cases of nine Southeast Asian countries were adapted from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker). All data was updated as of 24 April 2020.<h4>Results</h4>Preliminary positive results have been achieved given that the nation confirmed no new community-transmitted cases since 16 April and zero COVID-19 - related deaths throughout the 3-month pandemic period. To date, the pandemic has been successfully controlled thanks to the Vietnamese government's prompt, proactive and decisive responses including mobilization of the health care systems, security forces, economic policies, along with a creative and effective communication campaign corresponding with crucial milestones of the epidemic's progression.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Vietnam could be one of the role models in pandemic control for low-resource settings.

"33968730","The Immune-Related Gene HCST as a Novel Biomarker for the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.","Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common type of kidney tumor worldwide. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases showed that the immune-related gene (IRG) hematopoietic cell signal transducer (HCST) could provide guidance for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of ccRCC. The RNA-seq data of ccRCC tissues were extracted from two databases: TCGA (https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga) and GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Corresponding clinical information was downloaded from TCGA. Immune-related gene data were extracted from the IMMPORT website (https://www.immport.org/). Differential analysis with R software (https://www.r-project.org/) was used to obtain a prognosis model of ccRCC IRGs. The differences were combined with the clinical data to assess the usefulness of the HCST as a prognostic biomarker. Based on data obtained from the Oncomine (https://www.oncomine.org/), Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/), and PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) databases, the expression levels of the HCST in ccRCC, clinical-pathological indicators of relevance, and influence on prognosis were analyzed. Regulation of the HCST gene in ccRCC was assessed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). In TCGA/GEO databases, the high HCST expression in tumor tissues was significantly correlated to the TMN stage, tumor grade, invasion depth, and lymphatic metastasis (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The overall survival (OS) of patients with high HCST gene expression was significantly lower than that of patients with low HCST gene expression (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that the HCST expression level [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.630, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.042-2.552], tumor cell grade (HR = 1.829, 95% CI = 1.115-3.001), and distant metastasis (HR = 2.634, 95%, CI = 1.562-4.442) were independent risk factors affecting the OS of ccRCC patients (all, <i>p</i> < 0.05). The GSEA study showed that there was significant enrichment in cell adhesion, tumorigenesis, and immune and inflammatory responses in HCST high expression samples. Hematopoietic cell signal transducer expression was closely associated with the levels of infiltrating immune cells around ccRCC tissues, especially dendritic cells (DCs). In conclusion, the present study suggested that the HCST was interrelated to the clinicopathology and poor prognosis of ccRCC. High HCST expression was also closely correlated with the levels of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, especially DCs.","c(""https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga)""","""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).""","""https://www.immport.org/).""","""https://www.r-project.org/)""","""https://www.oncomine.org/)","""","""https://www.proteinatlas.org/)","""","""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""c"", """", """", ""cer"", ""gov"", ""about"", ""nci"", ""anization"", ""ccg"", ""research"", ""structural"", ""genomics"", ""tcga"")","c("""", """", """", ""ncbi"", ""nlm"", ""nih"", ""gov"", ""geo"")","c("""", """", """", ""immport"", """")","c("""", """", """", ""r"", ""project"", """")","c("""", """", """", ""onine"", """")","","c("""", """", """", ""proteinatlas"", """")","","c("""", """", ""pubmed"", ""ncbi"", ""nlm"", ""nih"", ""gov"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""immune"", ""related"", """", ""hcst"", ""as"", ""a"", ""novel"", ""biomarker"", """", ""diagnosis"", """", ""prognosis"", ""of"", ""clear"", """", ""renal"", ""carcinoma"")","c(""clear"", """", ""renal"", ""carcinoma"", ""ccrcc"", ""is"", """", """", ""mon"", ""type"", ""of"", ""kidney"", ""tumor"", ""worldwide"", ""analysis"", ""cer"", ""genome"", ""atlas"", ""tcga"", """", """", ""expression"", ""omnibus"", ""geo"", ""bases"", ""showed"", """", ""immune"", ""related"", ""irg"", ""hematopoietic"", ""signal"", ""transducer"", ""hcst"", ""could"", ""provide"", ""guidance"", """", ""diagnosis"", ""prognosis"", ""treatment"", """", ""seq"", """", ""tissues"", """", ""extracted"", """", """", """", """", ""gov"",

"33942461","The hop downy mildew pathogen Pseudoperonospora humuli.","Pseudoperonospora humuli is an obligate biotrophic oomycete that causes downy mildew, one of the most devastating diseases of cultivated hop, Humulus lupulus. Downy mildew occurs in all production areas of the crop in the Northern Hemisphere and Argentina. The pathogen overwinters in hop crowns and roots, and causes considerable crop loss. Downy mildew is managed by sanitation practices, planting of resistant cultivars, and fungicide applications. However, the scarcity of sources of host resistance and fungicide resistance in pathogen populations complicates disease management. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the symptoms of the disease, life cycle, virulence factors, and management of hop downy mildew, including various forecasting systems available in the world. Additionally, recent developments in genomics and effector discovery, and the future prospects of using such resources in successful disease management are also discussed.<h4>Taxonomy</h4>Class: Oomycota; Order: Peronosporales; Family: Peronosporaceae; Genus: Pseudoperonospora; Species: Pseudoperonospora humuli.<h4>Disease symptoms</h4>The disease is characterized by systemically infected chlorotic shoots called ""spikes"". Leaf symptoms and signs include angular chlorotic lesions and profuse sporulation on the abaxial side of the leaf. Under severe disease pressure, dark brown discolouration or lesions are observed on cones. Infected crowns have brown to black streaks when cut open. Cultivars highly susceptible to crown rot may die at this phase of the disease cycle without producing shoots. However, foliar symptoms may not be present on plants with systemically infected root systems.<h4>Infection process</h4>Pathogen mycelium overwinters in buds and crowns, and emerges on infected shoots in spring. Profuse sporulation occurs on infected tissues and sporangia are released and dispersed by air currents. Under favourable conditions, sporangia germinate and produce biflagellate zoospores that infect healthy tissue, thus perpetuating the infection cycle.

"34122523","Development and Validation of a Hypoxia-Related Signature for Predicting Survival Outcomes in Patients With Bladder Cancer.","<h4>Objectives</h4>This study aimed to develop and validate a hypoxia signature for predicting survival outcomes in patients with bladder cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>We downloaded the RNA sequence and the clinicopathologic data of the patients with bladder cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository?facetTab=files) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) databases. Hypoxia genes were retrieved from the Molecular Signatures Database (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp). Differentially expressed hypoxia-related genes were screened by univariate Cox regression analysis and Lasso regression analysis. Then, the selected genes constituted the hypoxia signature and were included in multivariate Cox regression to generate the risk scores. After that, we evaluate the predictive performance of this signature by multiple receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The CIBERSORT tool was applied to investigate the relationship between the hypoxia signature and the immune cell infiltration, and the maftool was used to summarize and analyze the mutational data. Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to investigate the related signaling pathways of differentially expressed genes in both risk groups. Furthermore, we developed a model and presented it with a nomogram to predict survival outcomes in patients with bladder cancer.<h4>Results</h4>Eight genes (AKAP12, ALDOB, CASP6, DTNA, HS3ST1, JUN, KDELR3, and STC1) were included in the hypoxia signature. The patients with higher risk scores showed worse overall survival time than the ones with lower risk scores in the training set (TCGA) and two external validation sets (GSE13507 and GSE32548). Immune infiltration analysis showed that two types of immune cells (M0 and M1 macrophages) had a significant infiltration in the high-risk group. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) analysis showed that the risk scores between the wild types and the mutation types of TP53, MUC16, RB1, and FGFR3 were significantly different. Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that immune or cancer-associated pathways belonged to the high-risk groups and metabolism-related signal pathways were enriched into the low-risk group. Finally, we constructed a predictive model with risk score, age, and stage and validated its performance in GEO datasets.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We successfully constructed and validated a novel hypoxia signature in bladder cancer, which could accurately predict patients' prognosis.","c(""https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository?facetTab=files)""","""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)""","""https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp)."")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""c"", """", ""portal"", ""gdc"", ""cer"", ""gov"", ""repository"", ""facettab"", ""files"")","c("""", """", """", ""ncbi"", ""nlm"", ""nih"", ""gov"", ""geo"")","c("""", """", """", ""gsea"", ""msigdb"", """", ""index"", ""jsp"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""development"", """", ""validation"", ""of"", ""a"", ""hypoxia"", ""related"", ""signature"", """", ""predicting"", ""survival"", ""outes"", ""in"", ""patients"", """", ""bladder"", ""cer"")","c(""<h4>objectives<"", ""h4>"", ""study"", ""aimed"", ""to"", ""develop"", """", ""validate"", ""a"", ""hypoxia"", ""signature"", """", ""predicting"", ""survival"", ""outes"", ""in"", ""patients"", """", ""bladder"", ""cer"", ""<h4>methods<"", ""h4>we"", ""downloaded"", """", """", ""sequence"", ""clinicopathologic"", """", ""of"", """", ""genome"", ""atlas"", ""tcga"", """", ""portal"", ""gdc"", ""gov"", ""repository"", ""facettab=files"", """", ""expression"", ""omnibus"", ""geo"", """", ""ncbi"", ""nlm"", ""nih"", ""bases"", ""s"", """",

We performed literature inclusion, data extraction, and trial quality evaluations. Methodological quality was assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook. Revman5.3 was used for all analyses.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 203 trials were identified and eleven studies involved 1094 participants aged 3-70 years. EAP was better than control group interventions in terms of effectiveness (risk ratio (RR): 0.51; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.36-0.70; <i>P</i> < 0.0001). EAP was superior to sham EAP in terms of improvement of the total nasal symptom score (RR: -0.50; 95% CI: -0.96-0.05; <i>P</i>‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.03), sneezing score (RR: -0.36; 95% CI: -0.59-0.12; <i>P</i>‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.003), global QoL score (RR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.04-0.08; <i>P</i>‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.03), and eye symptom score (RR: -0.36; 95% CI: -0.67-0.05; <i>P</i>‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.02).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Despite the positive results, it is premature to confirm the efficacy of EAP for treating AR.

Since then, it has been wildly spread from Wuhan, China, to Asia, European, and United States to become the pandemic worldwide. Now coronavirus disease 2019 were globally diagnosed over 3 084 740 cases with mortality of 212 561 toll. Current reports variants are found in SARS-CoV-2, majoring in functional ribonucleic acid (RNA) to transcribe into structural proteins as transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid (N) protein holds the virus RNA genome; the envelope (E) and membrane (M) alone with spike protein form viral envelope. The nonstructural RNA genome includes ORF1ab, ORF3, ORF6, 7a, 8, and ORF10 with highly conserved information for genome synthesis and replication in ORF1ab.<h4>Methods</h4>We apply genomic alignment analysis to observe SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/genebank/): MN 908947 (China, C1); MN985325 (United States: WA, UW); MN996527 (China, C2); MT007544 (Australia: Victoria, A1); MT027064 (United States: CA, UC); MT039890 (South Korea, K1); MT066175 (Taiwan, T1); MT066176 (Taiwan, T2); LC528232 (Japan, J1); and LC528233 (Japan, J2) and Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database (https://www.gisaid.org).

"34142845","First report of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris as the causal agent of necrotic leaf spot in Phaseolus vulgaris at Puebla, Mexico.","Beans are the most cultivated legume in the world. In Mexico, it is the second most important crop after corn (FAO 2020; SIAP 2020). Bean plants ""Flor de Mayo M38"" variety were affected by a foliar disease during the agricultural cycle 2019 in Puebla-Mexico (19¬∞02'46.6"" LN and 98¬∞05'15.6"" LO). Necrotic V- shaped lesions were observed on the margins of the leaves surrounded by yellow halos followed by foliar necrosis, affecting 40% of the crop. In Mexico this variety of cultivars is in great demand for local consumption and generates income in foreign currency (Castellanos et al. 1997). Sampling was carried out on 50 plants ""Flor de Mayo M38"" variety, with necrotic leaf symptoms from ten plots of one hectare. Samples were cut into pieces (5 mm), disinfested with 1% hypochlorite 3 min, and washed with sterile distilled water. Subsequently, samples were dried on sterile paper and placed on Petri plates containing yeast extract calcium carbonate dextrose agar (YDC) medium and kept at 36¬∞C for 3 days. Colonies of ten typical bacteria isolated from all symptomatic plants were Gram (-), small and uniform in size with rounded edges, yellow, convex with entire borders and mucoid appearance on YDC. Bacteria did not grow on 0.1% triphenyl tetrazolium chloride amended casamino acid, peptone, and glucose medium (CPG). Biochemical tests showed that isolates did not reduce nitrate to nitrites, had positive catalase and starch hydrolysis, while the Kovac oxidase test was negative (Schaad and White 1974). Genus identity of the representative isolate Xcf1-APJR, was confirmed by 16S rRNA encoding gene partial sequencing, using universal primers 518F (5'-CCAGCAGCCGCGGTAATACG-3') and 800R (5'-TACCAGGGTATCTAATCC-3') (Halim et al. 2020). BLASTn alignments against the nucleotide collection were 100% identical to Xanthomonas sequences including Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris strains NZ_AP019684.1, CP025750.1, and MN108237.1. The 1,418 bp sequence was deposited in the GenBank database under accession number MT645246. The identification of species/pathovar was accomplished by serological methods using a polyclonal antiserum specific for X. campestris pv. campestris (Popovic ÃÅ et al. 2013) with the DAS-ELISA commercial kit (catalog number 07122C/096, LOEWE Biochemica GmbH, Germany). The pathogenicity test was carried out on 50 healthy bean plants from the ""Flor de Mayo M38"" variety. Bacterial culture incubated at 28¬∞C for 48 h in YDC medium was used to prepare the bacterial suspension (108 CFU mL-1). The first two lower leaves of 30-day-old plants were inoculated by sprinkling. Ten plants sprayed with sterile distilled water were used as negative control. All plants were kept for 20 days in greenhouse at 18-26¬∞C and relative humidity of 60%. After seven days, chlorotic lesions developed on all inoculated plants that became necrotic from 14 days after inoculation (dai). Necrotic leaf spots merged at 14 dai to form necrotic areas of more than 20 mm in diameter, reaching total necrosis of the leaf tissue at 20 dai and were similar to the symptoms observed in the field. Koch's postulates were confirmed by the reisolation of Xcf1-APJR strain, which presented the same colony morphology, partial sequence, and polyclonal specific detection. This is the first report of this pathogen causing necrotic leaf spot in beans from the ""Flor de Mayo M38"" variety in Puebla-Mexico. The author(s) declare no conflict of interest.

"34125008","The ""second wave"" of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Arctic: regional and temporal dynamics.","This article focuses on the ""second wave"" of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Arctic and examines spatiotemporal patterns between July 2020 and January 2021. We analyse available COVID-19 data at the regional (subnational) level to elucidate patterns and typology of Arctic regions with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic. This article builds upon our previous research that examined the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic between February and July 2020. The pandemic's ""second wave"" observed in the Arctic between September 2020 and January 2021 was severe in terms of COVID-19 infections and fatalities, having particularly strong impacts in Alaska, Northern Russia and Northern Sweden. Based on the spatiotemporal patterns of the ""second wave"" dynamics, we identified 5 types of the pandemic across regions: Shockwaves (Iceland, Faroe Islands, Northern Norway, and Northern Finland), Protracted Waves (Northern Sweden), Tidal Waves (Northern Russia), Tsunami Waves (Alaska), and Isolated Splashes (Northern Canada and Greenland). Although data limitations and gaps persist, monitoring of COVID-19 is critical for developing a proper understanding of the pandemic in order to develop informed and effective responses to the current crisis and possible future pandemics in the Arctic.

"33116744","Identification of Novel Therapeutic Molecular Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease by Using Genetic Databases.","<h4>Purpose</h4>Utilization of genetic databases to identify genes involved in ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and their extra-intestinal manifestations.<h4>Methods</h4>Protein coding genes involved in ulcerative colitis (3783 genes), Crohn's disease (3980 genes), uveitis (1043 genes), arthritis (5583 genes), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) (1313 genes), and pyoderma gangrenosum (119 genes) were categorized using four genetic databases. These include Genecards: The Human Gene Database (www.genecards.org), DisGeNET (https://www.disgenet.org/), The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (http://ctdbase.org/) and the Universal Protein Resource (https://www.uniprot.org/). NDex, Network Data Exchange (http://www.ndexbio.org/), was then utilized for mapping a unique signal pathway from the identified shared genes involved in the above disease processes.<h4>Results</h4>We have detected a unique array of 20 genes with the highest probability of overlay in UC, CD, uveitis, arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and PSC. Figure 1 represents the interactome of these 20 protein coding genes. Of note, unique immune modulators in different disease processes are also noted. Interleukin-25 (IL-25) and monensin-resistant homolog 2 (MON-2) are only noted in UC, CD, pyoderma gangrenosum, and arthritis. Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) is involved in UC, CD, and arthritis. SLCO1B3 is exclusively involved with pyoderma gangrenosum, UC, and CD. As expected, TNF involvement is noted in CD, UC, PSC, and arthritis. Table 1 depicts the detailed result.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our work has identified a distinctive set of genes involved in IBD and its associated extra-intestinal disease processes. These genes play crucial roles in mechanisms of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis and further our understanding of this complex disease process. We postulate that these genes play a critical role at intersecting pathways involved in inflammatory bowel disease, and these novel molecules, their upstream and downstream effectors, are potential targets for future therapeutic agents.","c(""https://www.disgenet.org/)","""","""http://ctdbase.org/)""","""https://www.uniprot.org/).""","""http://www.ndexbio.org/)",""")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""c"", """", """", ""dist"", """")","","c("""", """", ""ctdbase"", """")","c("""", """", """", ""uniprot"", """")","c("""", """", """", ""ndexbio"", """")","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""identification"", ""of"", ""novel"", ""rapeutic"", ""molecular"", ""targets"", ""in"", ""inflammatory"", ""bowel"", ""disease"", ""by"", ""using"", ""tic"", ""bases"")","c(""<h4>purpose<"", ""h4>utilization"", ""of"", ""tic"", ""bases"", ""to"", ""identify"", ""s"", ""involved"", ""in"", ""ulcerative"", ""colitis"", ""uc"", ""crohn"", ""s"", ""disease"", ""cd"", """", ""ir"", ""extra"", ""intestinal"", ""manifestations"", ""<h4>methods<"", ""h4>protein"", ""coding"", ""3783"", ""3980"", ""uveitis"", ""1043"", ""arthritis"", ""5583"", ""primary"", ""sclerosing"", ""cholangitis"", ""psc"", ""1313"", ""pyoderma"", ""gangrenosum"", ""119"", """", ""categorized"", ""using"", ""f"", ""se"", ""include"", ""cards"", """", ""human"",

"33980298","IDSM ChemWebRDF: SPARQLing small-molecule datasets.","The Resource Description Framework (RDF), together with well-defined ontologies, significantly increases data interoperability and usability. The SPARQL query language was introduced to retrieve requested RDF data and to explore links between them. Among other useful features, SPARQL supports federated queries that combine multiple independent data source endpoints. This allows users to obtain insights that are not possible using only a single data source. Owing to all of these useful features, many biological and chemical databases present their data in RDF, and support SPARQL querying. In our project, we primary focused on PubChem, ChEMBL and ChEBI small-molecule datasets. These datasets are already being exported to RDF by their creators. However, none of them has an official and currently supported SPARQL endpoint. This omission makes it difficult to construct complex or federated queries that could access all of the datasets, thus underutilising the main advantage of the availability of RDF data. Our goal is to address this gap by integrating the datasets into one database called the Integrated Database of Small Molecules (IDSM) that will be accessible through a SPARQL endpoint. Beyond that, we will also focus on increasing mutual interoperability of the datasets. To realise the endpoint, we decided to implement an in-house developed SPARQL engine based on the PostgreSQL relational database for data storage. In our approach, data are stored in the traditional relational form, and the SPARQL engine translates incoming SPARQL queries into equivalent SQL queries. An important feature of the engine is that it optimises the resulting SQL queries. Together with optimisations performed by PostgreSQL, this allows efficient evaluations of SPARQL queries. The endpoint provides not only querying in the dataset, but also the compound substructure and similarity search supported by our Sachem project. Although the endpoint is accessible from an internet browser, it is mainly intended to be used for programmatic access by other services, for example as a part of federated queries. For regular users, we offer a rich web application called ChemWebRDF using the endpoint.

"33326008","Collecting and managing taxonomic data with NCBI-taxonomist.","<h4>Summary</h4>We present NCBI-taxonomist - a command-line tool written in Python that collects and manages taxonomic data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). NCBI-taxonomist does not depend on a pre-downloaded taxonomic database but can store data locally. NCBI-taxonomist has six commands to map, collect, extract, resolve, import and group taxonomic data that can be linked together to create powerful analytical pipelines. Because many life science databases use the same taxonomic information, the data managed by NCBI-taxonomist is not limited to NCBI and can be used to find data linked to taxonomic information present in other scientific databases.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>NCBI-taxonomist is implemented in Python 3 (‚â•3.8) and available at https://gitlab.com/janpb/ncbi-taxonomist and via PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/ncbi-taxonomist/), as a Docker container (https://gitlab.com/janpb/ncbi-taxonomist/container_registry/) and Singularity (v3.5.3) image (https://cloud.sylabs.io/library/jpb/ncbi-taxonomist).

"34196957","elaborator: A Novel App for Insights into Laboratory Data of Clinical Trials.","In clinical studies there are huge numbers of laboratory parameters available that are measured at several visits for several treatment groups. The status quo for presenting laboratory data in clinical trials consists in generating large numbers of tables and data listings. Such tables and listings are required for submissions to health authorities. However, reviewing laboratory data presented in the form of tables and listings is a lengthy and tedious process. Thus, to enable efficient exploration of laboratory data we developed elaborator, a comprehensive and easy-to-use interactive browser-based application. The elaborator app comprises three analyses types for addressing different questions, for example about changes in laboratory values that frequently occur, treatment-related changes and changes beyond the normal ranges. In this way, the app can be used by study teams for identifying safety signals in a clinical trial as well as for generating hypotheses that are further inspected with detailed analyses and possibly data from other sources. The elaborator app is implemented in the statistical software R. The R package elaborator can be obtained from https://cran.r-project.org/package=elaborator .

This database is an invaluable resource for researchers in the biological field, which classifies enzyme-related information in categories that are very useful to obtain specific functional and protein engineering information for enzyme families. However, the BRENDA web interface, the most used by researchers with a non-informatic background, does not allow the user to cross-reference data from different categories or sub-categories in the database. Obtaining information in an easy and fast way, in a friendly web interface, without the necessity to have a deep informatics knowledge, will facilitate and improve research in the enzymology and protein engineering field.<h4>Results</h4>We developed the Brenda Easy Search Tool (BEST), an interactive Shiny/R application that enables querying the BRENDA database for complex cross-tabulated characteristics, and retrieving enzyme-related parameters and information readily and efficiently, which can be used for the study of enzyme function or as an input for other bioinformatics tools.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>BEST and its tutorial are freely available from https://pesb2.cl/best/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","https://pesb2.cl/best/.<h4>Supplementary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""pesb2"", ""cl"", ""best"", ""h4"", ""supplementary"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""best"", ""a"", ""shiny"", ""r"", """", ""based"", ""application"", ""to"", ""easily"", ""retrieve"", ""cross"", ""related"", ""enzyme"", ""functional"", ""parameters"", """", ""inmation"", """", ""brenda"")","c(""<h4>motivation<"", ""h4>brenda"", ""is"", """", ""largest"", ""enzyme"", ""functional"", ""base"", ""containing"", ""inmation"", ""of"", ""84"", ""000"", ""experimenty"", ""characterized"", ""entries"", """", ""an"", ""invaluable"", ""resce"", """", ""researchers"", ""in"", ""biological"", ""field"", ""which"", ""classifies"", ""related"", ""categories"", """", """", ""very"", ""ful"", ""to"", ""obtain"", ""specific"", """", ""protein"", ""engineering"", ""families"", ""however"", ""brenda"", """", ""interface"", """", """", ""by"", """",

"34025412","The Genus <i>Eriosema</i> (Fabaceae): From the Ethnopharmacology to an Evidence-Based Phytotherapeutic Perspective?","The genus <i>Eriosema</i> (Fabaceae) includes approximately 150 species widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions of the world (Africa, Neotropics, Asia and Australia). Throughout these regions, several species are used since centuries in different traditional medicinal systems, while others are used as food or food supplement. The present review attempts to critically summarize current information concerning the uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology of the <i>Eriosema</i> genus and to evaluate the therapeutic potential. The information published in English and French (up to September 2020) on ethnopharmacology or traditional uses, chemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of <i>Eriosema</i> genus was collected from electronic databases [SciFinder, PubMed, Google, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, Prelude Medicinal Plants-http://www.ethnopharmacologia.org/recherche-dans-prelude/?plant, The Plant List (http://www.theplantlist.org/), POWO (http://powo.science.kew.org/) and IUCN Red List Categories (https://www.iucnredlist.org/)], conference proceedings, books, M.Sc. and Ph.D. dissertations. The information retrieved on the ethnomedicinal indications of <i>Eriosema</i> genus allowed to list 25 species (‚àº16.6% of the genus). The majority of uses is recorded from Africa. Phytochemical analyses of 8 species led to the identification and/or isolation of 107 compounds, with flavonoids (69.2%), chromones (7.5%) and benzoic acid derivatives (3.7%) as the main chemical classes. Pharmacological investigations with crude extracts and isolated compounds showed a broad range of activities including aphrodisiac, estrogenic, anti-osteoporosis, hypolipidemic, anti-diabetic, anti-diarrheal, anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, anthelmintic, anti-cancer, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. Despite the low number of <i>Eriosema</i> species tested, there is convincing evidence in <i>vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies validating some traditional and ethnobotanical uses. However, the utility of several of the described uses has not yet been confirmed in pharmacological studies.

"33719338","Construction of circRNA-Based ceRNA Network to Reveal the Role of circRNAs in the Progression and Prognosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.","<h4>Background</h4>Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are now under hot discussion as novel promising biomarkers for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of our study is to identify several competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks related to the prognosis and progression of HCC and to further investigate the mechanism of their influence on tumor progression.<h4>Methods</h4>First, we obtained gene expression data related to liver cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (http://www.portal.gdc.cancer.gov/), including microRNA (miRNA) sequence, RNA sequence, and clinical information. A co-expression network was constructed through the Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) software package in R software. The differentially expressed messenger RNAs (DEmRNAs) in the key module were analyzed with the Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp) to perform functional enrichment analysis including Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO). The data of miRNA expression and clinical information downloaded from TCGA were utilized for survival analysis to detach the prognostic value of the DEmiRNAs of the key module.<h4>Results</h4>The 201 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and 3,783 DEmRNAs were preliminarily identified through differential expression analysis. The co-expression networks of DEmiRNAs and DEmRNAs were constructed with WGCNA. Further analysis confirmed four miRNAs in the most significant module (blue module) were associated with the overall survival (OS) of patients with liver cancer, including hsa-miR-92b-3p, hsa-miR-122-3p, hsa-miR-139-5p, and hsa-miR-7850-5p. DAVID was used for functional enrichment analysis of 286 co-expressed mRNAs. The GO analysis results showed that the top enriched GO terms were oxidation-reduction process, extracellular exosome, and iron ion binding. In KEGG pathway analysis, the top three enriched terms included metabolic pathways, fatty acid degradation, and valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation. In addition, we intersected the miRNA-mRNA interaction prediction results with the differentially expressed and prognostic mRNAs. We found that hsa-miR-92b-3p can be related to CPEB3 and ACADL. By overlapping the data of predicted circRNAs by circBank and differentially expressed circRNAs of GSE94508, we screened has_circ_0077210 as the upstream regulatory molecule of hsa-miR-92b-3p. Hsa_circ_0077210/hsa-miR-92b-3p/cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein-3 (CPEB3) and acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase, long chain (ACADL) were validated in HCC tissue.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our research provides a mechanistic elucidation of the unknown ceRNA regulatory network in HCC. Hsa_circ_0077210 might serve a momentous therapeutic role to restrain the occurrence and development of HCC.","c(""http://www.portal.gdc.cancer.gov/)","""","""https://david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp)"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""c"", """", """", ""portal"", ""gdc"", ""cer"", ""gov"")","","c("""", """", ""david"", ""ncifcrf"", ""gov"", ""summary"", ""jsp"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""construction"", ""of"", ""circ"", ""based"", ""ce"", ""nerk"", ""to"", ""reveal"", """", ""role"", ""circs"", ""in"", ""progression"", """", ""prognosis"", ""hepatoular"", ""carcinoma"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>circular"", ""s"", ""circs"", """", ""now"", ""under"", ""hot"", ""discussion"", ""as"", ""novel"", ""promising"", ""biomarkers"", """", ""patients"", """", ""hepatoular"", ""carcinoma"", ""hcc"", """", ""purpose"", ""of"", """", ""study"", ""is"", ""to"", ""identify"", ""several"", ""peting"", ""endogenous"", """", ""ce"", ""nerks"", ""related"", ""prognosis"", """", ""progression"", ""furr"", ""investigate"", ""mechanism"", ""ir"", ""influence"", ""on"", ""tumor"", ""<h4>methods<"", ""h4>first"", ""we"", ""obtained"",

"34004273","Klebsiella MALDI TypeR: a web-based tool for Klebsiella identification based on MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.","Klebsiella pathogens affect human and animal health and are widely distributed in the environment. Among these, the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex, which includes seven phylogroups, is an important cause of community and hospital infections. The Klebsiella oxytoca species complex also causes hospital infections and antibiotic-associated haemorrhagic colitis. The unsuitability of currently used clinical microbiology methods to distinguish species within each of these species complexes leads to high rates of misidentifications that are masking the true clinical significance and potential epidemiological specificities of individual species. We developed a web-based tool, Klebsiella MALDI TypeR, a platform-independent and user-friendly application that enables uploading MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data in order to identify Klebsiella isolates at the species complex and phylogroup levels. The tool, available at https://maldityper.pasteur.fr/, leverages a database of previously identified biomarkers that are specific for species complexes, individual phylogroups, or related phylogroups. We obtained 84%-100% identification accuracy depending on phylogroup. Identification results are obtained in a few seconds from batches of uploaded spectral data. Klebsiella MALDI TypeR enables fast and reliable identification of Klebsiella strains that are often misidentified with standard microbiological methods.

"33777034","TCRMatch: Predicting T-Cell Receptor Specificity Based on Sequence Similarity to Previously Characterized Receptors.","The adaptive immune system in vertebrates has evolved to recognize non-self antigens, such as proteins expressed by infectious agents and mutated cancer cells. T cells play an important role in antigen recognition by expressing a diverse repertoire of antigen-specific receptors, which bind epitopes to mount targeted immune responses. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing have enabled the routine generation of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire data. Identifying the specific epitopes targeted by different TCRs in these data would be valuable. To accomplish that, we took advantage of the ever-increasing number of TCRs with known epitope specificity curated in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) since 2004. We compared seven metrics of sequence similarity to determine their power to predict if two TCRs have the same epitope specificity. We found that a comprehensive <i>k</i>-mer matching approach produced the best results, which we have implemented into TCRMatch, an openly accessible tool (http://tools.iedb.org/tcrmatch/) that takes TCR Œ≤-chain CDR3 sequences as an input, identifies TCRs with a match in the IEDB, and reports the specificity of each match. We anticipate that this tool will provide new insights into T cell responses captured in receptor repertoire and single cell sequencing experiments and will facilitate the development of new strategies for monitoring and treatment of infectious, allergic, and autoimmune diseases, as well as cancer.","http://tools.iedb.org/tcrmatch/)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""s"", ""iedb"", """", ""tcrmatch"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""tcrmatch"", ""predicting"", ""t"", """", ""receptor"", ""specificity"", ""based"", ""on"", ""sequence"", ""similarity"", ""to"", ""previously"", ""characterized"", ""receptors"")","c("""", ""adaptive"", ""immune"", ""system"", ""in"", ""vertebrates"", """", ""evolved"", ""to"", ""recognize"", ""non"", ""self"", ""antigens"", """", ""as"", ""proteins"", ""expressed"", ""by"", ""infectious"", ""agents"", """", ""mutated"", ""cer"", ""s"", ""t"", ""play"", ""an"", ""important"", ""role"", ""antigen"", ""recognition"", ""expressing"", ""a"", ""diverse"", ""repertoire"", ""of"", ""specific"", ""receptors"", ""which"", ""bind"", ""epitopes"", ""mount"", ""targeted"", ""responses"", ""recent"", ""advances"", """", ""throughput"", ""sequencing"", """",

"34020552","Genome-wide discovery of pre-miRNAs: comparison of recent approaches based on machine learning.","<h4>Motivation</h4>The genome-wide discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) involves identifying sequences having the highest chance of being a novel miRNA precursor (pre-miRNA), within all the possible sequences in a complete genome. The known pre-miRNAs are usually just a few in comparison to the millions of candidates that have to be analyzed. This is of particular interest in non-model species and recently sequenced genomes, where the challenge is to find potential pre-miRNAs only from the sequenced genome. The task is unfeasible without the help of computational methods, such as deep learning. However, it is still very difficult to find an accurate predictor, with a low false positive rate in this genome-wide context. Although there are many available tools, these have not been tested in realistic conditions, with sequences from whole genomes and the high class imbalance inherent to such data.<h4>Results</h4>In this work, we review six recent methods for tackling this problem with machine learning. We compare the models in five genome-wide datasets: Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Anopheles gambiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens. The models have been designed for the pre-miRNAs prediction task, where there is a class of interest that is significantly underrepresented (the known pre-miRNAs) with respect to a very large number of unlabeled samples. It was found that for the smaller genomes and smaller imbalances, all methods perform in a similar way. However, for larger datasets such as the H. sapiens genome, it was found that deep learning approaches using raw information from the sequences reached the best scores, achieving low numbers of false positives.<h4>Availability</h4>The source code to reproduce these results is in: http://sourceforge.net/projects/sourcesinc/files/gwmirna Additionally, the datasets are freely available in: https://sourceforge.net/projects/sourcesinc/files/mirdata.","c(""http://sourceforge.net/projects/sourcesinc/files/gwmirna""","""https://sourceforge.net/projects/sourcesinc/files/mirdata."")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""c"", """", ""scege"", ""net"", ""projects"", ""scesinc"", ""files"", ""gwmi"")","c("""", """", ""scege"", ""net"", ""projects"", ""scesinc"", ""files"", ""mir"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""genome"", ""wide"", ""discy"", ""of"", ""pre"", ""mis"", ""parison"", ""recent"", ""approaches"", ""based"", ""on"", ""machine"", ""learning"")","c(""<h4>motivation<"", ""h4>"", ""genome"", ""wide"", ""discy"", ""of"", ""micros"", ""mis"", ""involves"", ""identifying"", ""sequences"", ""having"", """", ""est"", ""chance"", ""being"", ""a"", ""novel"", ""mi"", ""precursor"", ""pre"", ""in"", """", ""possible"", ""in"", ""plete"", ""known"", """", ""usuy"", ""just"", ""few"", ""parison"", ""to"", ""millions"", ""didates"", """", """", ""be"", ""analyzed"", """", ""is"", ""particular"", ""interest"", ""non"", ""model"", ""species"", """", ""recently"", ""sequenced"", ""genomes"", ""w"",

Univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to determine the association of dietary factors with incidence and mortality rates of RCC adjusted for the effects of population age and potentially confounding factors. Intake of processed meats and consumption of alcohol were both positively associated with AS incidence rates of RCC (Œ≤ = 0.11, <i>P</i>‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001 and Œ≤ = 0.1, <i>P</i>‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.044, respectively).

The patients were randomly divided into a training set and a testing set. The X-tile analysis provides the best age and tumor size cut-off point, and changes continuous variables into categorical variables. The independent prognostic factors were determined by Cox regression analysis, and 2 nomograms were established. Receiver operating characteristic curves and calibration curves were used to evaluate the nomograms. Based on the nomograms, 2 web-based nomograms were established.<h4>Results</h4>Two hundred and twenty-eight cases were included in the OS nomogram construction, and were randomly divided into a training set (n=160) and a validation set (n=68). Age, T stage, bone metastasis, surgery, chemotherapy, marital status, tumor size, and tumor site were found to be correlated with OS. One hundred and eighty-three cases were enrolled in the CSS nomogram construction, and randomly divided into a training set (n=129) and a validation set (n=54). Age, bone metastasis, surgery, chemotherapy, tumor size, and tumor site were found to be correlated with CSS. Two nomograms were established to predict OS and CSS.

"33027504","PredHPI: an integrated web server platform for the detection and visualization of host-pathogen interactions using sequence-based methods.","<h4>Motivation</h4>Understanding the mechanisms underlying infectious diseases is fundamental to develop prevention strategies. Host-pathogen interactions (HPIs) are actively studied worldwide to find potential genomic targets for the development of novel drugs, vaccines and other therapeutics. Determining which proteins are involved in the interaction system behind an infectious process is the first step to develop an efficient disease control strategy. Very few computational methods have been implemented as web services to infer novel HPIs, and there is not a single framework which combines several of those approaches to produce and visualize a comprehensive analysis of HPIs.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we introduce PredHPI, a powerful framework that integrates both the detection and visualization of interaction networks in a single web service, facilitating the apprehension of model and non-model host-pathogen systems to aid the biologists in building hypotheses and designing appropriate experiments. PredHPI is built on high-performance computing resources on the backend capable of handling proteome-scale sequence data from both the host as well as pathogen. Data are displayed in an information-rich and interactive visualization, which can be further customized with user-defined layouts. We believe PredHPI will serve as an invaluable resource to diverse experimental biologists and will help advance the research in the understanding of complex infectious diseases.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>PredHPI tool is freely available at http://bioinfo.usu.edu/PredHPI/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Sup plementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","http://bioinfo.usu.edu/PredHPI/.<h4>Supplementary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""bioinfo"", ""usu"", ""edu"", ""predhpi"", ""h4"", ""supplementary"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""predhpi"", ""an"", ""integrated"", """", ""server"", ""platm"", """", """", ""detection"", """", ""visualization"", ""of"", ""host"", ""pathogen"", ""interactions"", ""using"", ""sequence"", ""based"", ""methods"")","c(""<h4>motivation<"", ""h4>understing"", """", ""mechanisms"", ""underlying"", ""infectious"", ""diseases"", ""is"", ""fundamental"", ""to"", ""develop"", ""prevention"", ""strategies"", ""host"", ""pathogen"", ""interactions"", ""hpis"", """", ""actively"", ""studied"", ""worldwide"", ""find"", ""potential"", ""genomic"", ""targets"", """", ""development"", ""of"", ""novel"", ""s"", ""vaccines"", """", ""or"", ""rapeutics"", ""determining"", ""which"", ""proteins"", ""involved"", ""in"", ""interaction"", ""system"", ""behind"", ""an"", ""process"", ""first"",

"32657416","MutCombinator: identification of mutated peptides allowing combinatorial mutations using nucleotide-based graph search.","<h4>Motivation</h4>Proteogenomics has proven its utility by integrating genomics and proteomics. Typical approaches use data from next-generation sequencing to infer proteins expressed. A sample-specific protein sequence database is often adopted to identify novel peptides from matched mass spectrometry-based proteomics; nevertheless, there is no software that can practically identify all possible forms of mutated peptides suggested by various genomic information sources.<h4>Results</h4>We propose MutCombinator, which enables us to practically identify mutated peptides from tandem mass spectra allowing combinatorial mutations during the database search. It uses an upgraded version of a variant graph, keeping track of frame information. The variant graph is indexed by nine nucleotides for fast access. Using MutCombinator, we could identify more mutated peptides than previous methods, because combinations of point mutations are considered and also because it can be practically applied together with a large mutation database such as COSMIC.

Atomistic structural details of protein-protein interactions may provide important information that can facilitate the design of therapeutic agents. GalaxyHeteromer is a freely available automatic web server (http://galaxy.seoklab.org/heteromer) that predicts protein heterodimer complex structures from two subunit protein sequences or structures. When subunit structures are unavailable, they are predicted by template- or distance-prediction-based modelling methods. Heterodimer complex structures can be predicted by both template-based and ab initio docking, depending on the template's availability. Structural templates are detected from the protein structure database based on both the sequence and structure similarities. The templates for heterodimers may be selected from monomer and homo-oligomer structures, as well as from hetero-oligomers, owing to the evolutionary relationships of heterodimers with domains of monomers or subunits of homo-oligomers. In addition, the server employs one of the best ab initio docking methods when heterodimer templates are unavailable. The multiple heterodimer structure models and the associated scores, which are provided by the web server, may be further examined by user to test or develop functional hypotheses or to design new functional molecules.","http://galaxy.seoklab.org/heteromer)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""galaxy"", ""seoklab"", """", ""heteromer"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""galaxyheteromer"", ""protein"", ""heterodimer"", ""structure"", ""prediction"", ""by"", ""template"", ""based"", """", ""ab"", ""initio"", ""docking"")","c(""protein"", ""interactions"", ""play"", ""crucial"", ""roles"", ""in"", ""diverse"", ""biological"", ""processes"", ""including"", ""various"", ""disease"", ""progressions"", ""atomistic"", ""structural"", ""details"", ""of"", ""may"", ""provide"", ""important"", ""inmation"", """", """", ""facilitate"", """", ""design"", ""rapeutic"", ""agents"", ""galaxyheteromer"", ""is"", ""a"", ""freely"", ""available"", ""automatic"", """", ""server"", """", ""galaxy"", ""seoklab"", """", ""heteromer"", ""predicts"", ""heterodimer"", ""plex"", ""structures"", """",

"34213323","pdCSM-cancer: Using Graph-Based Signatures to Identify Small Molecules with Anticancer Properties.","The development of new, effective, and safe drugs to treat cancer remains a challenging and time-consuming task due to limited hit rates, restraining subsequent development efforts. Despite the impressive progress of quantitative structure-activity relationship and machine learning-based models that have been developed to predict molecule pharmacodynamics and bioactivity, they have had mixed success at identifying compounds with anticancer properties against multiple cell lines. Here, we have developed a novel predictive tool, pdCSM-cancer, which uses a graph-based signature representation of the chemical structure of a small molecule in order to accurately predict molecules likely to be active against one or multiple cancer cell lines. pdCSM-cancer represents the most comprehensive anticancer bioactivity prediction platform developed till date, comprising trained and validated models on experimental data of the growth inhibition concentration (GI50%) effects, including over 18,000 compounds, on 9 tumor types and 74 distinct cancer cell lines. Across 10-fold cross-validation, it achieved Pearson's correlation coefficients of up to 0.74 and comparable performance of up to 0.67 across independent, non-redundant blind tests. Leveraging the insights from these cell line-specific models, we developed a generic predictive model to identify molecules active in at least 60 cell lines. Our final model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of up to 0.94 on 10-fold cross-validation and up to 0.94 on independent non-redundant blind tests, outperforming alternative approaches. We believe that our predictive tool will provide a valuable resource to optimizing and enriching screening libraries for the identification of effective and safe anticancer molecules.

However, the process of designing prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs), which contain a primer binding site and a reverse-transcription template at the 3' end, is more complex than that for the single guide RNAs used with CRISPR nucleases or base editors. Furthermore, the assessment of high-throughput sequencing data after prime editors (PEs) have been employed should consider the unique feature of PEs; thus, pre-existing assessment tools cannot directly be adopted for PEs. Here, we present two user-friendly web-based tools for PEs, named PE-Designer and PE-Analyzer.

A transparent, systematic, and accessible method of linking BCTs with the processes through which they change behavior (i.e., their mechanisms of action [MoAs]) would advance the understanding of intervention effects and improve theory and intervention development. The purpose of this study is to triangulate evidence for hypothesized BCT-MoA links obtained in two previous studies and present the results in an interactive, online tool. Two previous studies generated evidence on links between 56 BCTs and 26 MoAs based on their frequency in literature synthesis and on expert consensus. Concordance between the findings of the two studies was examined using multilevel modeling. Uncertainties and differences between the two studies were reconciled by 16 behavior change experts using consensus development methods. The resulting evidence was used to generate an online tool. The two studies showed concordance for 25 of the 26 MoAs and agreement for 37 links and for 460 ""nonlinks.""

"33750020","KnetMiner: a comprehensive approach for supporting evidence-based gene discovery and complex trait analysis across species.","The generation of new ideas and scientific hypotheses is often the result of extensive literature and database searches, but, with the growing wealth of public and private knowledge, the process of searching diverse and interconnected data to generate new insights into genes, gene networks, traits and diseases is becoming both more complex and more time-consuming. To guide this technically challenging data integration task and to make gene discovery and hypotheses generation easier for researchers, we have developed a comprehensive software package called KnetMiner which is open-source and containerized for easy use. KnetMiner is an integrated, intelligent, interactive gene and gene network discovery platform that supports scientists explore and understand the biological stories of complex traits and diseases across species. It features fast algorithms for generating rich interactive gene networks and prioritizing candidate genes based on knowledge mining approaches. KnetMiner is used in many plant science institutions and has been adopted by several plant breeding organizations to accelerate gene discovery. The software is generic and customizable and can therefore be readily applied to new species and data types; for example, it has been applied to pest insects and fungal pathogens; and most recently repurposed to support COVID-19 research. Here, we give an overview of the main approaches behind KnetMiner and we report plant-centric case studies for identifying genes, gene networks and trait relationships in Triticum aestivum (bread wheat), as well as, an evidence-based approach to rank candidate genes under a large Arabidopsis thaliana QTL.

"33823122","Long-Term Outcomes in Intensive Care Unit Patients with Delirium: A Population-Based Cohort Study.","<h4>Rationale</h4>Delirium is common in the intensive care unit (ICU) and portends worse ICU and hospital outcomes. The effect of delirium in the ICU on post-hospital discharge mortality and health resource utilization is less well known.<h4>Objectives</h4>To estimate mortality and health resource utilization 2.5-years post-hospital discharge in critically ill patients admitted to ICU.<h4>Methods</h4>Population-based, propensity-score matched, retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to one of fourteen medical-surgical ICUs from January 1, 2014 to June 30, 2016. Delirium was measured by the 8-point Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). The primary outcome was mortality. The secondary outcome was a composite measure of subsequent emergency department visits, hospital readmission, or mortality.<h4>Measurements and main results</h4>There were 5,936 propensity score matched patients with and without incident delirium who survived to hospital discharge. Delirium was associated with increased mortality 0 to 30-days post-hospital discharge [Hazard Ratio (HR): 1.44 (95%CI: 1.08-1.92)]. There was no significant difference in mortality more than 30 days post-hospital discharge (delirium: 3.9%, no delirium: 2.6%). There was a persistent increased risk of emergency department visits, hospital readmissions, or mortality post-hospital discharge [HR: 1.12 (95%CI: 1.07-1.17)] throughout the study period.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ICU delirium is associated with increased mortality 0 to 30 days post-hospital discharge.

This study aimed to compare the changes in the network connectivity of different brain tissues under different pathological conditions, analyzed the biological pathways and genes that are significantly related to disease progression, and further predicted the potential therapeutic drug targets.<h4>Methods</h4>Expression of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed with postmortem cingulate cortex (ACC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) mRNA expression profile datasets downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, including 76 MDD patients and 76 healthy subjects in ACC and 63 MDD patients and 63 healthy subjects in PFC. The co-expression network construction was based on system network analysis. The function of the genes was annotated by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD, http://www.hprd.org/ ) was used for gene interaction relationship mapping.<h4>Results</h4>We filtered 586 DEGs in ACC and 616 DEGs in PFC for further analysis. By constructing the co-expression network, we found that the gene connectivity was significantly reduced under disease conditions (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.04 in PFC and P‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.227e-09 in ACC). Crosstalk analysis showed that CD19, PTDSS2 and NDST2 were significantly differentially expressed in ACC and PFC of MDD patients. Among them, CD19 and PTDSS2 have been targeted by several drugs in the Drugbank database. KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that the function of CD19 and PTDSS2 were enriched with the pathway of Glycerophospholipid metabolism and T cell receptor signaling pathway.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Co-expression network and tissue comparing analysis can identify signaling pathways and cross talk genes related to MDD, which may provide novel insight for understanding the molecular mechanisms of MDD.","http://www.hprd.org/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", """", ""hprd"", """")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""identification"", ""of"", ""major"", ""depressive"", ""disorder"", ""disease"", ""related"", ""s"", """", ""functional"", ""pathways"", ""based"", ""on"", ""system"", ""dynamic"", ""changes"", ""nerk"", ""connectivity"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>major"", ""depressive"", ""disorder"", ""mdd"", ""is"", ""a"", ""leading"", ""psychiatric"", """", ""involves"", ""plex"", ""abnormal"", ""biological"", ""functions"", """", ""neural"", ""nerks"", """", ""study"", ""aimed"", ""to"", ""p"", """", ""changes"", ""in"", ""nerk"", ""connectivity"", ""of"", ""different"", ""brain"", ""tissues"", ""under"", ""pathological"", ""conditions"", ""analyzed"", ""pathways"", ""s"", """", ""signifitly"", ""related"", ""disease"", ""progression"", ""furr"", ""predicted"", ""potential"",

Here we introduce Consensus Pathway Analysis (CPA), a web-based platform that allows researchers to (i) perform pathway analysis using eight established methods (GSEA, GSA, FGSEA, PADOG, Impact Analysis, ORA/Webgestalt, KS-test, Wilcox-test), (ii) perform meta-analysis of multiple datasets, (iii) combine methods and datasets to accurately identify the impacted pathways underlying the studied condition and (iv) interactively explore impacted pathways, and browse relationships between pathways and genes. The platform supports three types of input: (i) a list of differentially expressed genes, (ii) genes and fold changes and (iii) an expression matrix. It also allows users to import data from NCBI GEO. The CPA platform currently supports the analysis of multiple organisms using KEGG and Gene Ontology, and it is freely available at http://cpa.tinnguyen-lab.com.","http://cpa.tinnguyen-lab.com.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""cpa"", ""tinnguyen"", ""lab"", """")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""cpa"", ""a"", """", ""based"", ""platm"", """", ""consensus"", ""pathway"", ""analysis"", """", ""interactive"", ""visualization"")","c(""in"", ""molecular"", ""biology"", """", ""tics"", ""re"", ""is"", ""a"", ""large"", ""gap"", ""between"", """", ""ease"", ""of"", """", ""collection"", """", ""ability"", ""to"", ""extract"", ""knowledge"", """", ""se"", ""contributing"", """", ""fact"", """", ""living"", ""anisms"", """", ""plex"", ""systems"", ""whose"", ""emerging"", ""pheypes"", ""results"", ""multiple"", ""interactions"", ""taking"", ""place"", ""on"", ""various"", ""pathways"", ""dems"", ""powerful"", ""yet"", """", ""friendly"", ""pathway"", ""analysis"", ""s"",

"33618727","A clinical trials corpus annotated with UMLS entities to enhance the access to evidence-based medicine.","<h4>Background</h4>The large volume of medical literature makes it difficult for healthcare professionals to keep abreast of the latest studies that support Evidence-Based Medicine. Natural language processing enhances the access to relevant information, and gold standard corpora are required to improve systems. To contribute with a new dataset for this domain, we collected the Clinical Trials for Evidence-Based Medicine in Spanish (CT-EBM-SP) corpus.<h4>Methods</h4>We annotated 1200 texts about clinical trials with entities from the Unified Medical Language System semantic groups: anatomy (ANAT), pharmacological and chemical substances (CHEM), pathologies (DISO), and lab tests, diagnostic or therapeutic procedures (PROC). We doubly annotated 10% of the corpus and measured inter-annotator agreement (IAA) using F-measure. As use case, we run medical entity recognition experiments with neural network models.<h4>Results</h4>This resource contains 500 abstracts of journal articles about clinical trials and 700 announcements of trial protocols (292 173 tokens). We annotated 46 699 entities (13.98% are nested entities). Regarding IAA agreement, we obtained an average F-measure of 85.65% (¬±4.79, strict match) and 93.94% (¬±3.31, relaxed match). In the use case experiments, we achieved recognition results ranging from 80.28% (¬±00.99) to 86.74% (¬±00.19) of average F-measure.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results show that this resource is adequate for experiments with state-of-the-art approaches to biomedical named entity recognition.

"33592504","TAP 1.0: A robust immunoinformatic tool for the prediction of tumor T-cell antigens based on AAindex properties.","Immunotherapy is a research area with great potential in drug discovery for cancer treatment. Because of the capacity of tumor antigens to activate the immune response and promote the destruction of tumor cells, they are considered excellent immunotherapeutic drugs. In this work, we evaluated fifteen machine learning algorithms for the classification of tumor antigens. For this purpose, we build robust datasets, carefully selected from the TANTIGEN and IEDB databases. The feature computation of all antigens in this study was performed by developing a script written in Python 3.8, which allowed the calculation of 544 physicochemical and biochemical properties extracted from the AAindex database. All classifiers were subjected to the training, 10-fold cross-validation, and testing on an independent dataset. The results of this study showed that the quadratic discriminant classifier presented the best performance measures over the independent dataset, accuracy = 0.7384, AUC = 0.817, recall = 0.676, precision = 0.7857, F1 = 0.713, kappa = 0.4764, and Matthews correlation coefficient = 0.4834, outperforming common machine learning classifiers used in the bioinformatics area. We believe that our prediction model could be of great importance in the field of cancer immunotherapy for the search of potential tumor antigens.

"33539179","Prenatal Exposure to Nitrate from Drinking Water and Markers of Fetal Growth Restriction: A Population-Based Study of Nearly One Million Danish-Born Children.","<h4>Background</h4>High levels of nitrate (NO3-) in drinking water cause methemoglobinemia in infants; however, few studies have examined the potential effects of low-level exposure on fetal growth, and the results have been inconsistent.<h4>Objectives</h4>We sought to assess the association between maternal exposure to nitrate in drinking water during pregnancy and offspring size at birth in a nationwide study of full-term (‚â•37‚Äâwk gestation) live-born singletons.<h4>Methods</h4>We estimated maternal nitrate exposure for 898,206 births in Denmark during 1991-2011 by linkage of individual home address(es) with nitrate data from the national monitoring database. Maternal address during pregnancy, infant size at birth [i.e., birth weight, low birth weight (LBW), body length, and birth head circumference] and covariates were compiled from the Danish Civil Registration System, the Danish Medical Birth Register, and The Integrated Database for Longitudinal Labor Market Research. Linear and logistic models with generalized estimating equations were used to account for multiple births to an individual. Nitrate exposure was modeled using five categories and as a log-transformed continuous variable.<h4>Results</h4>There was evidence of a decreasing trend in models for term birth weight using categorical or continuous measures of exposure. Modeling exposure continuously, a difference of -9.71‚Äâg (95% confidence interval: -14.60, -4.81) was predicted at 25‚Äâmg/L (half the value of the European Union drinking water standard) compared with 0‚Äâmg/L‚ÄâNO3-. Body length also decreased as nitrate concentrations increased in categorical and continuous models. There was little evidence of an association between NO3- and head circumference or LBW.<h4>Discussion</h4>Although the estimated effects were small, our findings for live singleton births to Danish-born parents suggest that maternal intake of nitrate from drinking water may reduce term birth weight and length, which are markers of intrauterine growth. However, there was little evidence for an association between nitrate and head circumference or LBW. Future studies in other populations and with data on dietary sources of nitrate are encouraged to confirm or refute these findings. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7331.","https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7331.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""doi"", """", ""10"", ""1289"", ""ehp7331"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""prenatal"", ""exposure"", ""to"", ""nitrate"", """", ""drinking"", ""water"", """", ""markers"", ""of"", ""fetal"", ""growth"", ""restriction"", ""a"", ""population"", ""based"", ""study"", ""nearly"", """", ""million"", ""danish"", ""born"", ""children"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>"", ""levels"", ""of"", ""nitrate"", ""no3"", ""in"", ""drinking"", ""water"", ""ca"", ""memoglobinemia"", ""infants"", ""however"", ""few"", ""studies"", """", ""examined"", """", ""potential"", ""effects"", ""low"", ""level"", ""exposure"", ""on"", ""fetal"", ""growth"", """", ""results"", """", ""inconsistent"", ""<h4>objectives<"", ""h4>we"", ""sought"", ""to"", ""assess"", ""association"", ""between"", ""matel"", ""during"", ""pregnancy"", ""offspring"", ""size"", ""at"", ""birth"", ""a"", ""nationwide"", ""study"", ""full"", ""term"",

Existing mNGS data analysis tools typically require bioinformatics expertise and access to local server-class hardware resources. For many research laboratories, this presents an obstacle, especially in resource-limited environments.<h4>Findings</h4>We present IDseq, an open source cloud-based metagenomics pipeline and service for global pathogen detection and monitoring (https://idseq.net). The IDseq Portal accepts raw mNGS data, performs host and quality filtration steps, then executes an assembly-based alignment pipeline, which results in the assignment of reads and contigs to taxonomic categories. The taxonomic relative abundances are reported and visualized in an easy-to-use web application to facilitate data interpretation and hypothesis generation. Furthermore, IDseq supports environmental background model generation and automatic internal spike-in control recognition, providing statistics that are critical for data interpretation. IDseq was designed with the specific intent of detecting novel pathogens. Here, we benchmark novel virus detection capability using both synthetically evolved viral sequences and real-world samples, including IDseq analysis of a nasopharyngeal swab sample acquired and processed locally in Cambodia from a tourist from Wuhan, China, infected with the recently emergent SARS-CoV-2.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The IDseq Portal reduces the barrier to entry for mNGS data analysis and enables bench scientists, clinicians, and bioinformaticians to gain insight from mNGS datasets for both known and novel pathogens.","https://idseq.net).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""idseq"", ""net"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""idseq"", ""an"", ""open"", ""sce"", ""cloud"", ""based"", ""pipeline"", """", ""analysis"", ""service"", """", ""metagenomic"", ""pathogen"", ""detection"", ""monitoring"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>metagenomic"", ""next"", ""ration"", ""sequencing"", ""mngs"", """", ""enabled"", """", ""rapid"", ""unbiased"", ""detection"", """", ""identification"", ""of"", ""microbes"", ""out"", ""pathogen"", ""specific"", ""reagents"", ""culturing"", ""or"", ""a"", ""priori"", ""knowledge"", ""microbial"", ""lscape"", """", ""analysis"", ""requires"", ""series"", ""putationy"", ""intensive"", ""processing"", ""steps"", ""to"", ""accurately"", ""determine"", ""position"", ""sample"", ""existing"", ""s"", ""typicy"", ""require"",

"33185649","A system-level analysis of patient disease trajectories based on clinical, phenotypic and molecular similarities.","<h4>Motivation</h4>Incorporating the temporal dimension into multimorbidity studies has shown to be crucial for achieving a better understanding of the disease associations. Furthermore, due to the multifactorial nature of human disease, exploring disease associations from different perspectives can provide a holistic view to support the study of their aetiology.<h4>Results</h4>In this work, a temporal systems-medicine approach is proposed for identifying time-dependent multimorbidity patterns from patient disease trajectories, by integrating data from electronic health records with genetic and phenotypic information. Specifically, the disease trajectories are clustered using an unsupervised algorithm based on dynamic time warping and three disease similarity metrics: clinical, genetic and phenotypic. An evaluation method is also presented for quantitatively assessing, in the different disease spaces, both the cluster homogeneity and the respective similarities between the associated diseases within individual trajectories. The latter can facilitate exploring the origin(s) in the identified disease patterns. The proposed integrative methodology can be applied to any longitudinal cohort and disease of interest.

"32840574","KORP-PL: a coarse-grained knowledge-based scoring function for protein-ligand interactions.","<h4>Motivation</h4>Despite the progress made in studying protein-ligand interactions and the widespread application of docking and affinity prediction tools, improving their precision and efficiency still remains a challenge. Computational approaches based on the scoring of docking conformations with statistical potentials constitute a popular alternative to more accurate but costly physics-based thermodynamic sampling methods. In this context, a minimalist and fast sidechain-free knowledge-based potential with a high docking and screening power can be very useful when screening a big number of putative docking conformations.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present a novel coarse-grained potential defined by a 3D joint probability distribution function that only depends on the pairwise orientation and position between protein backbone and ligand atoms. Despite its extreme simplicity, our approach yields very competitive results with the state-of-the-art scoring functions, especially in docking and screening tasks. For example, we observed a twofold improvement in the median 5% enrichment factor on the DUD-E benchmark compared to Autodock Vina results. Moreover, our results prove that a coarse sidechain-free potential is sufficient for a very successful docking pose prediction.<h4>Availabilityand implementation</h4>The standalone version of KORP-PL with the corresponding tests and benchmarks are available at https://team.inria.fr/nano-d/korp-pl/ and https://chaconlab.org/modeling/korp-pl.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","c(""https://team.inria.fr/nano-d/korp-pl/""","""https://chaconlab.org/modeling/korp-pl.<h4>Supplementary"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""c"", """", ""team"", ""inria"", ""fr"", ""nano"", ""d"", ""korp"", ""pl"")","c("""", """", ""chaconlab"", """", ""modeling"", ""korp"", ""pl"", ""h4"", ""supplementary"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""korp"", ""pl"", ""a"", ""coarse"", ""grained"", ""knowledge"", ""based"", ""scoring"", ""function"", """", ""protein"", ""lig"", ""interactions"")","c(""<h4>motivation<"", ""h4>despite"", """", ""progress"", ""made"", ""in"", ""studying"", ""protein"", ""lig"", ""interactions"", """", ""widespread"", ""application"", ""of"", ""docking"", ""affinity"", ""prediction"", ""s"", ""improving"", ""ir"", ""precision"", ""efficiency"", ""still"", ""remains"", ""a"", ""chenge"", ""putational"", ""approaches"", ""based"", ""on"", ""scoring"", ""conmations"", """", ""statistical"", ""potentials"", ""constitute"", ""popular"", ""altetive"", ""to"", """", ""accurate"", ""but"", ""costly"", ""physics"", ""rmodynamic"",

"32742675","Network-based protein structural classification.","Experimental determination of protein function is resource-consuming. As an alternative, computational prediction of protein function has received attention. In this context, protein structural classification (PSC) can help, by allowing for determining structural classes of currently unclassified proteins based on their features, and then relying on the fact that proteins with similar structures have similar functions. Existing PSC approaches rely on sequence-based or direct three-dimensional (3D) structure-based protein features. By contrast, we first model 3D structures of proteins as protein structure networks (PSNs). Then, we use network-based features for PSC. We propose the use of graphlets, state-of-the-art features in many research areas of network science, in the task of PSC. Moreover, because graphlets can deal only with unweighted PSNs, and because accounting for edge weights when constructing PSNs could improve PSC accuracy, we also propose a deep learning framework that automatically learns network features from weighted PSNs. When evaluated on a large set of approximately 9400 CATH and approximately 12 800 SCOP protein domains (spanning 36 PSN sets), the best of our proposed approaches are superior to existing PSC approaches in terms of accuracy, with comparable running times.

"32615035","mycoCSM: Using Graph-Based Signatures to Identify Safe Potent Hits against Mycobacteria.","Development of new potent, safe drugs to treat Mycobacteria has proven to be challenging, with limited hit rates of initial screens restricting subsequent development efforts. Despite significant efforts and the evolution of quantitative structure-activity relationship as well as machine learning-based models for computationally predicting molecule bioactivity, there is an unmet need for efficient and reliable methods for identifying biologically active compounds against Mycobacterium that are also safe for humans. Here we developed mycoCSM, a graph-based signature approach to rapidly identify compounds likely to be active against bacteria from the genus Mycobacterium, or against specific Mycobacteria species. mycoCSM was trained and validated on eight organism-specific and for the first time a general Mycobacteria data set, achieving correlation coefficients of up to 0.89 on cross-validation and 0.88 on independent blind tests, when predicting bioactivity in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration. In addition, we also developed a predictor to identify those compounds likely to penetrate in necrotic tuberculosis foci, which achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.75. Together with a built-in estimator of the maximum tolerated dose in humans, we believe this method will provide a valuable resource to enrich screening libraries with potent, safe molecules.

"31318409","PTM-Logo: a program for generation of sequence logos based on position-specific background amino-acid probabilities.","<h4>Summary</h4>Identification of the amino-acid motifs in proteins that are targeted for post-translational modifications (PTMs) is of great importance in understanding regulatory networks. Information about targeted motifs can be derived from mass spectrometry data that identify peptides containing specific PTMs such as phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and acetylation. Comparison of input data against a standardized 'background' set allows identification of over- and under-represented amino acids surrounding the modified site. Conventionally, calculation of targeted motifs assumes a random background distribution of amino acids surrounding the modified position. However, we show that probabilities of amino acids depend on (i) the type of the modification and (ii) their positions relative to the modified site. Thus, software that identifies such over- and under-represented amino acids should make appropriate adjustments for these effects. Here we present a new program, PTM-Logo, that generates representations of these amino acid preferences ('logos') based on position-specific amino-acid probability backgrounds calculated either from user-input data or curated databases.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>PTM-Logo is freely available online at http://sysbio.chula.ac.th/PTMLogo/ or https://hpcwebapps.cit.nih.gov/PTMLogo/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","c(""http://sysbio.chula.ac.th/PTMLogo/""","""https://hpcwebapps.cit.nih.gov/PTMLogo/.<h4>Supplementary"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""c"", """", ""sysbio"", ""chula"", ""ac"", ""th"", ""ptmlogo"")","c("""", """", ""hpcapps"", ""cit"", ""nih"", ""gov"", ""ptmlogo"", ""h4"", ""supplementary"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""ptm"", ""logo"", ""a"", ""program"", """", ""ration"", ""of"", ""sequence"", ""logos"", ""based"", ""on"", ""position"", ""specific"", ""background"", ""amino"", ""acid"", ""probabilities"")","c(""<h4>summary<"", ""h4>identification"", ""of"", """", ""amino"", ""acid"", ""motifs"", ""in"", ""proteins"", """", """", ""targeted"", """", ""post"", ""translational"", ""modifications"", ""ptms"", ""is"", ""great"", ""importance"", ""understing"", ""regulatory"", ""nerks"", ""inmation"", ""about"", """", ""be"", ""derived"", """", ""mass"", ""spectrometry"", """", ""identify"", ""peptides"", ""containing"", ""specific"", """", ""as"", ""phosphorylation"", ""ubiquitylation"", """", ""acetylation"", ""parison"", ""input"", ""against"", ""a"",

"33579190","A graph-based algorithm for detecting rigid domains in protein structures.","<h4>Background</h4>Conformational transitions are implicated in the biological function of many proteins. Structural changes in proteins can be described approximately as the relative movement of rigid domains against each other. Despite previous efforts, there is a need to develop new domain segmentation algorithms that are capable of analysing the entire structure database efficiently and do not require the choice of protein-dependent tuning parameters such as the number of rigid domains.<h4>Results</h4>We develop a graph-based method for detecting rigid domains in proteins. Structural information from multiple conformational states is represented by a graph whose nodes correspond to amino acids. Graph clustering algorithms allow us to reduce the graph and run the Viterbi algorithm on the associated line graph to obtain a segmentation of the input structures into rigid domains. In contrast to many alternative methods, our approach does not require knowledge about the number of rigid domains. Moreover, we identified default values for the algorithmic parameters that are suitable for a large number of conformational ensembles.

Data from participants aged 18 to 75 years were collected as the baseline survey of Action on Salt China in 2018. Of 5454 adults, 5353 completed 24-hour urine collection. The average sodium, potassium excretion, and sodium-to-potassium molar ratio were 4318.1¬±1814.1 mg/d (equivalent to 11.0¬±4.6 g/d of salt), 1573.7¬±627.1 mg/d, and 5.0¬±2.1, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounding factors and correcting for regression dilution, each 1000-mg increase in sodium excretion was associated with increased systolic BP (1.32 mm‚ÄâHg [95% CI, 0.92-1.81]) and diastolic BP (0.34 mm‚ÄâHg [95% CI, 0.09-0.60]). Each 1000-mg increase in potassium excretion was inversely associated with systolic BP (-3.19 mm‚ÄâHg [95% CI, -4.38 to -2.20]) and diastolic BP (-1.56 mm‚ÄâHg [95% CI, -2.29 to -0.90]). Each unit increase in sodium-to-potassium molar ratio was associated with an increase of systolic BP by 1.21 mm‚ÄâHg (95% CI, 0.91-1.60) and diastolic BP by 0.44 mm‚ÄâHg (95% CI, 0.24-0.64). The relationships between sodium and BP mostly increase with the rise of BP quantiles. Potassium shows the opposite trend. The current sodium intake in Chinese adults remains high and potassium intake is low. Sodium and sodium-to-potassium ratio were positively associated with BP, whereas potassium was inversely associated with BP.

Using a risk score based on the nine-hub RBP model, we separated the LUAD patients into a low-risk group and a high-risk group. The outcomes revealed that patients in the high-risk group had poorer survival than those in the low-risk group. This signature was validated in the GEO database. Further study revealed that the risk score can be an independent prognostic biomarker for LUAD.

"32777814","BSAseq: an interactive and integrated web-based workflow for identification of causal mutations in bulked F2 populations.","<h4>Summary</h4>With the advance of next-generation sequencing technologies and reductions in the costs of these techniques, bulked segregant analysis (BSA) has become not only a powerful tool for mapping quantitative trait loci but also a useful way to identify causal gene mutations underlying phenotypes of interest. However, due to the presence of background mutations and errors in sequencing, genotyping, and reference assembly, it is often difficult to distinguish true causal mutations from background mutations. In this study, we developed the BSAseq workflow, which includes an automated bioinformatics analysis pipeline with a probabilistic model for estimating the linked region (the region linked to the causal mutation) and an interactive Shiny web application for visualizing the results. We deeply sequenced a sorghum male-sterile parental line (ms8) to capture the majority of background mutations in our bulked F2 data. We applied the workflow to 11 bulked sorghum F2 populations and 1 rice F2 population and identified the true causal mutation in each population. The workflow is intuitive and straightforward, facilitating its adoption by users without bioinformatics analysis skills. We anticipate that the BSAseq workflow will be broadly applicable to the identification of causal mutations for many phenotypes of interest.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>BSAseq is freely available on https://www.sciapps.org/page/bsa.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","https://www.sciapps.org/page/bsa.<h4>Supplementary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", """", ""sciapps"", """", ""page"", ""bsa"", ""h4"", ""supplementary"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""bsaseq"", ""an"", ""interactive"", """", ""integrated"", """", ""based"", ""workflow"", """", ""identification"", ""of"", ""causal"", ""mutations"", ""in"", ""bulked"", ""f2"", ""populations"")","c(""<h4>summary<"", ""h4>"", """", ""advance"", ""of"", ""next"", ""ration"", ""sequencing"", ""technologies"", """", ""reductions"", ""in"", ""costs"", ""se"", ""techniques"", ""bulked"", ""segregant"", ""analysis"", ""bsa"", """", ""bee"", """", ""only"", ""a"", ""powerful"", """", """", ""mapping"", ""quantitative"", ""trait"", ""loci"", ""but"", """", ""ful"", ""way"", ""to"", ""identify"", ""causal"", """", ""mutations"", ""underlying"", ""pheypes"", ""interest"", ""however"", ""due"", ""presence"", ""background"", ""errors"", ""geyping"",

"33529135","Disruption of the Atrophy-based Functional Network in Multiple Sclerosis Is Associated with Clinical Disability: Validation of a Meta-Analytic Model in Resting-State Functional MRI.","Background In multiple sclerosis (MS), gray matter (GM) atrophy exhibits a specific pattern, which correlates strongly with clinical disability. However, the mechanism of regional specificity in GM atrophy remains largely unknown. Recently, the network degeneration hypothesis (NDH) was quantitatively defined (using coordinate-based meta-analysis) as the atrophy-based functional network (AFN) model, which posits that localized GM atrophy in MS is mediated by functional networks. Purpose To test the NDH in MS in a data-driven manner using the AFN model to direct analyses in an independent test sample. Materials and Methods Model fit testing was conducted with structural equation modeling, which is based on the computation of semipartial correlations. Model verification was performed in coordinate-based data of healthy control participants from the BrainMap database (<i>https://www.brainmap.org</i>). Model validation was conducted in prospectively acquired resting-state functional MRI in participants with relapsing-remitting MS who were recruited between September 2018 and January 2019. Correlation analyses of model fit indices and volumetric measures with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores and disease duration were performed. Results Model verification of healthy control participants included 80‚Äâ194 coordinates from 9035 experiments. Model verification in healthy control data resulted in excellent model fit (root mean square error of approximation, 0.037; 90% CI: 0.036, 0.039). Twenty participants (mean age, 36 years ¬± 9 [standard deviation]; 12 women) with relapsing-remitting MS were evaluated. Model validation in resting-state functional MRI in participants with MS resulted in deviation from optimal model fit (root mean square error of approximation, 0.071; 90% CI: 0.070, 0.072), which correlated with EDSS scores (<i>r</i> = 0.68; <i>P</i> = .002). Conclusion The atrophy-based functional network model predicts functional network disruption in multiple sclerosis (MS), thereby supporting the network degeneration hypothesis. On resting-state functional MRI scans, reduced functional network integrity in participants with MS had a strong positive correlation with clinical disability. ¬© RSNA, 2021 <i>Online supplemental material is available for this article.</i>","https://www.brainmap.org</i>).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", """", ""brainmap"", """", ""i"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""disruption"", ""of"", """", ""atrophy"", ""based"", ""functional"", ""nerk"", ""in"", ""multiple"", ""sclerosis"", ""is"", ""associated"", """", ""clinical"", ""disability"", ""validation"", ""a"", ""meta"", ""analytic"", ""model"", ""resting"", ""state"", ""mri"")","c(""background"", ""in"", ""multiple"", ""sclerosis"", ""ms"", ""gray"", ""matter"", ""gm"", ""atrophy"", ""exhib"", ""a"", ""specific"", ""pattern"", ""which"", ""correlates"", ""strongly"", """", ""clinical"", ""disability"", ""however"", """", ""mechanism"", ""of"", ""regional"", ""specificity"", ""remains"", ""largely"", ""unknown"", ""recently"", ""nerk"", ""deration"", ""hyposis"", ""ndh"", """", ""quantitatively"", ""defined"", ""using"", ""coordinate"", ""based"", ""meta"", ""analysis"", ""as"", ""functional"", ""afn"", ""model"", ""pos"", """", ""localized"",

"32241255","EpiMOLAS: an intuitive web-based framework for genome-wide DNA methylation analysis.","<h4>Background</h4>DNA methylation is a crucial epigenomic mechanism in various biological processes. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) technology, methylated cytosine sites can be revealed at the single nucleotide level. However, the WGBS data analysis process is usually complicated and challenging.<h4>Results</h4>To alleviate the associated difficulties, we integrated the WGBS data processing steps and downstream analysis into a two-phase approach. First, we set up the required tools in Galaxy and developed workflows to calculate the methylation level from raw WGBS data and generate a methylation status summary, the mtable. This computation environment is wrapped into the Docker container image DocMethyl, which allows users to rapidly deploy an executable environment without tedious software installation and library dependency problems. Next, the mtable files were uploaded to the web server EpiMOLAS_web to link with the gene annotation databases that enable rapid data retrieval and analyses.<h4>Conclusion</h4>To our knowledge, the EpiMOLAS framework, consisting of DocMethyl and EpiMOLAS_web, is the first approach to include containerization technology and a web-based system for WGBS data analysis from raw data processing to downstream analysis. EpiMOLAS will help users cope with their WGBS data and also conduct reproducible analyses of publicly available data, thereby gaining insights into the mechanisms underlying complex biological phenomenon.

There is a pressing need to have a new open community resource tool for intuitive visual exploration, interpretation, and communication of these gene/protein regulatory networks by the cancer research community. In this work, ProNetView-ccRCC (http://ccrcc.cptac-network-view.org/), an interactive web-based network exploration portal for investigating phosphopeptide co-expression network inferred based on the CPTAC clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) phosphoproteomics data is introduced. ProNetView-ccRCC enables quick, user-intuitive visual interactions with the ccRCC tumor phosphoprotein co-expression network comprised of 3614 genes, as well as 30 functional pathway-enriched network modules. Users can interact with the network portal and can conveniently query for association between abundance of each phosphopeptide in the network and clinical variables such as tumor grade.","http://ccrcc.cptac-network-view.org/)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""ccrcc"", ""cptac"", ""nerk"", ""view"", """")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""prtview"", ""ccrcc"", ""a"", """", ""based"", ""portal"", ""to"", ""interactively"", ""explore"", ""clear"", """", ""renal"", ""carcinoma"", ""proteogenomics"", ""nerks"")","c(""to"", ""better"", ""underst"", """", ""molecular"", ""basis"", ""of"", ""cer"", ""nci"", ""s"", ""clinical"", ""proteomics"", ""tumor"", ""analysis"", ""consortium"", ""cptac"", """", """", ""perming"", ""prehensive"", ""large"", ""scale"", ""proteogenomic"", ""characterizations"", ""multiple"", ""types"", """", """", ""protein"", ""regulatory"", ""nerks"", """", ""subsequently"", ""being"", ""derived"", ""based"", ""on"", ""se"", ""profiles"", ""which"", ""serve"", ""as"", ""s"", ""gain"", ""systems"", ""level"", ""understing"", ""factories"",

"31307376","PhenPath: a tool for characterizing biological functions underlying different phenotypes.","<h4>Background</h4>Many diseases are associated with complex patterns of symptoms and phenotypic manifestations. Parsimonious explanations aim at reconciling the multiplicity of phenotypic traits with the perturbation of one or few biological functions. For this, it is necessary to characterize human phenotypes at the molecular and functional levels, by exploiting gene annotations and known relations among genes, diseases and phenotypes. This characterization makes it possible to implement tools for retrieving functions shared among phenotypes, co-occurring in the same patient and facilitating the formulation of hypotheses about the molecular causes of the disease.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce PhenPath, a new resource consisting of two parts: PhenPathDB and PhenPathTOOL. The former is a database collecting the human genes associated with the phenotypes described in Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and OMIM Clinical Synopses. Phenotypes are then associated with biological functions and pathways by means of NET-GE, a network-based method for functional enrichment of sets of genes. The present version considers only phenotypes related to diseases. PhenPathDB collects information for 18 OMIM Clinical synopses and 7137 HPO phenotypes, related to 4292 diseases and 3446 genes. Enrichment of Gene Ontology annotations endows some 87.7, 86.9 and 73.6% of HPO phenotypes with Biological Process, Molecular Function and Cellular Component terms, respectively. Furthermore, 58.8 and 77.8% of HPO phenotypes are also enriched for KEGG and Reactome pathways, respectively. Based on PhenPathDB, PhenPathTOOL analyzes user-defined sets of phenotypes retrieving diseases, genes and functional terms which they share. This information can provide clues for interpreting the co-occurrence of phenotypes in a patient.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The resource allows finding molecular features useful to investigate diseases characterized by multiple phenotypes, and by this, it can help researchers and physicians in identifying molecular mechanisms and biological functions underlying the concomitant manifestation of phenotypes.

"33997237","Comparative proteomics of <i>Brucella melitensis</i> is a useful toolbox for developing prophylactic interventions in a One-Health context.","Brucellosis caused by <i>Brucella melitensis</i> is a zoonosis frequently reported in the Mediterranean and Middle-East regions and responsible for important economic losses and reduced animal welfare. To date, current strategies applied to control or eradicate the disease relies on diagnostic tests that suffer from limited specificity in non-vaccinated animals; while prophylactic measures, when applied, use a live attenuated bacterial strain characterized by residual virulence on adult pregnant animals and difficulties in distinguishing vaccinated from infected animals. To overcome these issues, studies are desired to elucidate the bacterial biology and the pathogenetic mechanisms of both the vaccinal strain and the pathogenic strains. Proteomics has a potential in tackling issues of One-Health concern; here, we employed label-free shotgun proteomics to investigate the protein repertoire of the vaccinal strain <i>B. melitensis</i> Rev.1 and compare it with the proteome of the <i>Brucella melitensis</i> 16 M, a reference strain representative of <i>B. melitensis</i> field strains. Comparative proteomics profiling underlines common and diverging traits between the two strains. Common features suggest the potential biochemical routes responsible for the residual virulence of the vaccinal strain, whilst the diverging traits are suggestive biochemical signatures to be further investigated to provide an optimized diagnostic capable of discriminating the vaccinated from infected animals.

"33942874","Human IRES Atlas: an integrative platform for studying IRES-driven translational regulation in humans.","It is now known that cap-independent translation initiation facilitated by internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) is vital in selective cellular protein synthesis under stress and different physiological conditions. However, three problems make it hard to understand transcriptome-wide cellular IRES-mediated translation initiation mechanisms: (i) complex interplay between IRESs and other translation initiation-related information, (ii) reliability issue of in silico cellular IRES investigation and (iii) labor-intensive in vivo IRES identification. In this research, we constructed the Human IRES Atlas database for a comprehensive understanding of cellular IRESs in humans. First, currently available and suitable IRES prediction tools (IRESfinder, PatSearch and IRESpy) were used to obtain transcriptome-wide human IRESs. Then, we collected eight genres of translation initiation-related features to help study the potential molecular mechanisms of each of the putative IRESs. Three functional tests (conservation, structural RNA-protein scores and conditional translation efficiency) were devised to evaluate the functionality of the identified putative IRESs. Moreover, an easy-to-use interface and an IRES-translation initiation interaction map for each gene transcript were implemented to help understand the interactions between IRESs and translation initiation-related features. Researchers can easily search/browse an IRES of interest using the web interface and deduce testable mechanism hypotheses of human IRES-driven translation initiation based on the integrated results. In summary, Human IRES Atlas integrates putative IRES elements and translation initiation-related experiments for better usage of these data and deduction of mechanism hypotheses.

However, growing evidences support the view of this reversible reaction also as a regulatory post-translational modification. Thus, the oxidation of methionine residues has been reported to have multiple and varied implications for protein function. However, despite the importance of this modification and the abundance of reports, all these data are scattered in the literature. No database/resource on methionine sulfoxidation exists currently. Since this information is useful to gain further insights into the redox regulation of cellular proteins, we have created a primary database of experimentally confirmed sulfoxidation sites.<h4>Results</h4>MetOSite currently contains 7242 methionine sulfoxide sites found in 3562 different proteins from 23 species, with Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana and Bacillus cereus as the main contributors. Each collected site has been classified according to the effect of its sulfoxidation on the biological properties of the modified protein. Thus, MetOSite documents cases where the sulfoxidation of methionine leads to (i) gain of activity, (ii) loss of activity, (iii) increased protein-protein interaction susceptibility, (iv) decreased protein-protein interaction susceptibility, (v) changes in protein stability and (vi) changes in subcellular location.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>MetOSite is available at https://metosite.uma.es.","https://metosite.uma.es.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""metosite"", ""uma"", ""es"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""metosite"", ""an"", ""integrated"", ""resce"", """", """", ""study"", ""of"", ""methionine"", ""residues"", ""sulfoxidation"")","c(""<h4>motivation<"", ""h4>"", ""oxidation"", ""of"", ""protein"", ""bound"", ""methionine"", ""to"", ""m"", ""sulfoxide"", """", ""traditiony"", """", ""regarded"", ""as"", ""an"", ""oxidative"", ""damage"", ""however"", ""growing"", ""evidences"", ""support"", """", ""view"", """", ""reversible"", ""reaction"", """", ""a"", ""regulatory"", ""post"", ""translational"", ""modification"", ""thus"", ""residues"", ""reported"", """", ""multiple"", """", ""varied"", ""implications"", """", ""function"", ""despite"", ""importance"", ""abundance"", ""reports"",

To this end, we have constructed a multiple abiotic stress responsive TF-miRNA-gene regulatory network for <i>O. sativa</i> using a transcriptome and degradome sequencing data meta-analysis approach. The theoretical network approach has shown the networks to be dense, scale-free, and small-world, which makes the network stable. They are also invariant to scale change where an efficient, quick transmission of biological signals occurs within the network on extrinsic hindrance. The analysis also deciphered the existence of communities (cluster of TF, miRNA, and genes) working together to help plants in acclimatizing to multiple stresses. It highlighted that genes, TFs, and miRNAs shared by multiple stress conditions that work as hubs or bottlenecks for signal propagation, for example, during the interaction between stress-responsive genes (TFs/miRNAs/other genes) and genes involved in floral development pathways under multiple environmental stresses. This study further highlights how the fine-tuning feedback mechanism works for balancing stress tolerance and how timely flowering enable crops to survive in adverse conditions. This study developed the abiotic stress-responsive regulatory network, APRegNet database (http://lms.snu.edu.in/APRegNet), which may help researchers studying the roles of miRNAs and TFs. Furthermore, it advances current understanding of multiple abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms.","http://lms.snu.edu.in/APRegNet)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""lms"", ""snu"", ""edu"", ""in"", ""apregnet"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""abiotic"", ""stress"", ""responsive"", ""mi"", """", ""transcription"", ""factor"", ""mediated"", """", ""regulatory"", ""nerk"", ""in"", ""<i>oryza"", ""sativa<"", ""i>"", ""construction"", ""structural"", ""measure"", ""study"")","c(""climate"", ""changes"", """", ""environmental"", ""stresses"", """", ""a"", ""consequential"", ""association"", """", ""crop"", ""plant"", ""growth"", ""yield"", ""meaning"", ""it"", ""is"", ""necessary"", ""to"", ""cultivate"", ""crops"", """", ""tolerance"", ""toward"", """", ""changing"", ""disturbances"", """", ""as"", ""water"", ""stress"", ""temperature"", ""fluctuation"", ""salt"", ""toxicity"", ""recent"", ""studies"", ""shown"", ""trans"", ""acting"", ""regulatory"", ""elements"", ""including"", ""micros"", ""mis"", ""transcription"", ""factors"",

To unravel the complexity of the clinical phenotype-genotype network, we used cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and associated non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) (i.e. miRNAs, long ncRNAs, etc.) as the case for the study of CVDs at a systems or network level. We first integrated a database of CVDs and ncRNAs (CVDncR, http://sysbio.org.cn/cvdncr/) to construct CVD-ncRNA networks and annotate their clinical associations. To characterize the networks, we then separated the miRNAs into two groups, i.e. universal miRNAs associated with at least two types of CVDs and specific miRNAs related only to one type of CVD. Our analyses indicated two interesting patterns in these CVD-ncRNA networks. First, scale-free features were present within both CVD-miRNA and CVD-lncRNA networks; second, universal miRNAs were more likely to be CVDs biomarkers. These results were confirmed by computational functional analyses. The findings offer theoretical guidance for decoding CVD-ncRNA associations and will facilitate the screening of CVD ncRNA biomarkers.

"30222561","Large-Scale Study of Perceptual Video Quality.","The great variations of videographic skills in videography, camera designs, compression and processing protocols, communication and bandwidth environments, and displays leads to an enormous variety of video impairments. Current noreference (NR) video quality models are unable to handle this diversity of distortions. This is true in part because available video quality assessment databases contain very limited content, fixed resolutions, were captured using a small number of camera devices by a few videographers and have been subjected to a modest number of distortions. As such, these databases fail to adequately represent real world videos, which contain very different kinds of content obtained under highly diverse imaging conditions and are subject to authentic, complex and often commingled distortions that are difficult or impossible to simulate. As a result, NR video quality predictors tested on real-world video data often perform poorly. Towards advancing NR video quality prediction, we have constructed a largescale video quality assessment database containing 585 videos of unique content, captured by a large number of users, with wide ranges of levels of complex, authentic distortions. We collected a large number of subjective video quality scores via crowdsourcing. A total of 4776 unique participants took part in the study, yielding more than 205000 opinion scores, resulting in an average of 240 recorded human opinions per video. We demonstrate the value of the new resource, which we call the LIVE Video Quality Challenge Database (LIVE-VQC for short), by conducting a comparison of leading NR video quality predictors on it. This study is the largest video quality assessment study ever conducted along several key dimensions: number of unique contents, capture devices, distortion types and combinations of distortions, study participants, and recorded subjective scores.

In total, 357 random mtDNA sequences were obtained from different haplogroups, based on the classification of PhyloTree. Additionally, we included a control group of five sequences (Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Homo sapiens neanderthalensis, Yoruba15, and the revised Cambridge reference sequence). VAMPhyRE employs a virtual hybridization technique, using probes that specifically bind to their complementary sequences in the genome. We used 65,536 probes of 8 nucleotides to identify potential sites where hybridization occurs between the mtDNA and the specific probe, forming different heteroduplexes and thus, creating a unique and specific genomic fingerprint for each sequence. Genomic fingerprints were compared, and a table of distances was calculated to obtain a mitochondrial phylogenomic tree with the macrohaplogroups, L, N, M, and R, and their corresponding haplogroups, according to universal nomenclature. The results obtained suggest an accuracy of 97.25% for the distribution of the 357 mtDNA sequences in the four macrohaplogroups and their corresponding haplogroups when compared with other mtDNA classification tools that require reference sequences and do not offer an analysis based on an evolutionary approach.

"30715167","The global dissemination of bacterial infections necessitates the study of reverse genomic epidemiology.","Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionized the genotyping of bacterial pathogens and is expected to become the new gold standard for tracing the transmissions of bacterial infectious diseases for public health purposes. Traditional genomic epidemiology often uses WGS as a verification tool, namely, when a common source or epidemiological link is suspected, the collected isolates are sequenced for the determination of clonal relationships. However, increasingly frequent international travel and food transportation, and the associated potential for the cross-border transmission of bacterial pathogens, often lead to an absence of information on bacterial transmission routes. Here we introduce the concept of 'reverse genomic epidemiology', i.e. when isolates are inspected by genome comparisons to be sufficiently similar to one another, they are assumed to be a consequence of infection from a common source. Through BacWGSTdb (http://bacdb.org/BacWGSTdb/), a database we have developed for bacterial genome typing and source tracking, we have found that almost the entire analyzed 20 bacterial species exhibit the phenomenon of cross-border clonal dissemination. Five networks were further identified in which isolates sharing nearly identical genomes were collected from at least five different countries. Three of these have been documented as real infectious disease outbreaks, therefore demonstrating the feasibility and authority of reverse genomic epidemiology.

"32897080","METATRYP v 2.0: Metaproteomic Least Common Ancestor Analysis for Taxonomic Inference Using Specialized Sequence Assemblies-Standalone Software and Web Servers for Marine Microorganisms and Coronaviruses.","We present METATRYP version 2 software that identifies shared peptides across the predicted proteomes of organisms within environmental metaproteomics studies to enable accurate taxonomic attribution of peptides during protein inference. Improvements include ingestion of complex sequence assembly data categories (metagenomic and metatranscriptomic assemblies, single cell amplified genomes, and metagenome assembled genomes), prediction of the least common ancestor (LCA) for a peptide shared across multiple organisms, increased performance through updates to the backend architecture, and development of a web portal (https://metatryp.whoi.edu). Major expansion of the marine METATRYP database with predicted proteomes from environmental sequencing confirms a low occurrence of shared tryptic peptides among disparate marine microorganisms, implying tractability for targeted metaproteomics. METATRYP was designed to facilitate ocean metaproteomics and has been integrated into the Ocean Protein Portal (https://oceanproteinportal.org); however, it can be readily applied to other domains. We describe the rapid deployment of a coronavirus-specific web portal (https://metatryp-coronavirus.whoi.edu/) to aid in use of proteomics on coronavirus research during the ongoing pandemic. A coronavirus-focused METATRYP database identified potential SARS-CoV-2 peptide biomarkers and indicated very few shared tryptic peptides between SARS-CoV-2 and other disparate taxa analyzed, sharing <1% peptides with taxa outside of the betacoronavirus group, establishing that taxonomic specificity is achievable using tryptic peptide-based proteomic diagnostic approaches.","c(""https://metatryp.whoi.edu).""","""https://oceanproteinportal.org);""","""https://metatryp-coronavirus.whoi.edu/)"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""c"", """", ""metatryp"", ""whoi"", ""edu"")","c("""", """", ""oceanproteinportal"", """")","c("""", """", ""metatryp"", ""coronavirus"", ""whoi"", ""edu"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""metatryp"", ""v"", ""2"", ""0"", ""metaproteomic"", ""least"", ""mon"", ""ancestor"", ""analysis"", """", ""taxonomic"", ""inference"", ""using"", ""specialized"", ""sequence"", ""assemblies"", ""stal"", ""softw"", """", """", ""servers"", ""marine"", ""microanisms"", ""coronavirs"")","c(""we"", ""present"", ""metatryp"", ""version"", ""2"", ""softw"", """", ""identifies"", ""shd"", ""peptides"", ""across"", """", ""predicted"", ""proteomes"", ""of"", ""anisms"", ""in"", ""environmental"", ""metaproteomics"", ""studies"", ""to"", ""enable"", ""accurate"", ""taxonomic"", ""attribution"", ""during"", ""protein"", ""inference"", ""improvements"", ""include"", ""ingestion"", ""plex"", ""sequence"", ""assembly"", """", ""categories"", ""metagenomic"", """", ""metatranscriptomic"", ""assemblies"", ""single"", """", ""amplified"", ""genomes"",

"34020544","Ori-Finder 3: a web server for genome-wide prediction of replication origins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.","DNA replication is a fundamental process in all organisms; this event initiates at sites termed origins of replication. The characteristics of eukaryotic replication origins are best understood in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For this species, origin prediction algorithms or web servers have been developed based on the sequence features of autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs). However, their performances are far from satisfactory. By utilizing the Z-curve methodology, we present a novel pipeline, Ori-Finder 3, for the computational prediction of replication origins in S. cerevisiae at the genome-wide level based solely on DNA sequences. The ARS exhibiting both an AT-rich stretch and ARS consensus sequence element can be predicted at the single-nucleotide level. For the identified ARSs in the S. cerevisiae reference genome, 83 and 60% of the top 100 and top 300 predictions matched the known ARS records, respectively. Based on Ori-Finder 3, we subsequently built a database of the predicted ARSs identified in more than a hundred S. cerevisiae genomes.

"29997612","CDG: An Online Server for Detecting Biologically Closest Disease-Causing Genes and its Application to Primary Immunodeficiency.","High-throughput genomic technologies yield about 20,000 variants in the protein-coding exome of each individual. A commonly used approach to select candidate disease-causing variants is to test whether the associated gene has been previously reported to be disease-causing. In the absence of known disease-causing genes, it can be challenging to associate candidate genes with specific genetic diseases. To facilitate the discovery of novel gene-disease associations, we determined the putative biologically closest known genes and their associated diseases for 13,005 human genes not currently reported to be disease-associated. We used these data to construct the closest disease-causing genes (CDG) server, which can be used to infer the closest genes with an associated disease for a user-defined list of genes or diseases. We demonstrate the utility of the CDG server in five immunodeficiency patient exomes across different diseases and modes of inheritance, where CDG dramatically reduced the number of candidate genes to be evaluated. This resource will be a considerable asset for ascertaining the potential relevance of genetic variants found in patient exomes to specific diseases of interest.

CanVaS comprises germline genetic data from 7,363 Greek individuals with a personal and/or family history of malignancy. The data set incorporates approximately 24,000 functionally annotated rare variants in 97 established or suspected cancer susceptibility genes. For each variant, allele frequency for the Greek population, interpretation for clinical significance, anonymized family and segregation information, as well as phenotypic traits of the carriers, are included. Moreover, information on the geographic distribution of the variants across the country is provided, enabling the study of Greek population isolates. Direct comparisons between Greek (sub)populations with relevant genetic resources are supported, allowing fine-grain localized adjustment of guidelines and clinical decision-making.

"34107869","PINIR: a comprehensive information resource for Pin-II type protease inhibitors.","<h4>Background</h4>Serine protease inhibitors belonging to the Potato type-II Inhibitor family Protease Inhibitors (Pin-II type PIs) are essential plant defense molecules. They are characterized by multiple inhibitory repeat domains, conserved disulfide bond pattern, and a tripeptide reactive center loop. These features of Pin-II type PIs make them potential molecules for protein engineering and designing inhibitors for agricultural and therapeutic applications. However, the diversity in these PIs remains unexplored due to the lack of annotated protein sequences and their functional attributes in the available databases.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a database, PINIR (Pin-II type PIs Information Resource), by systematic collection and manual annotation of 415 Pin-II type PI protein sequences. For each PI, the number and position for signature sequences are specified: 695 domains, 75 linkers, 63 reactive center loops, and 10 disulfide bond patterns are identified and mapped. Database analysis revealed novel subcategories of PIs, species-correlated occurrence of inhibitory domains, reactive center loops, and disulfide bond patterns. By analyzing linker regions, we predict that alternative processing at linker regions could generate PI variants in the Solanaceae family.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PINIR ( https://pinir.ncl.res.in ) provides a web interface for browsing and analyzing the protein sequences of Pin-II type PIs. Information about signature sequences, spatio-temporal expression, biochemical properties, gene sequences, and literature references are provided. Analysis of PINIR depicts conserved species-specific features of Pin-II type PI protein sequences.

KEGG mapping is a predictive method of reconstructing molecular network systems from molecular building blocks based on the concept of functional orthologs. Since the introduction of the KEGG NETWORK database, various diseases have been associated with network variants, which are perturbed molecular networks caused by human gene variants, viruses, other pathogens and environmental factors. The network variation maps are created as aligned sets of related networks showing, for example, how different viruses inhibit or activate specific cellular signaling pathways. The KEGG pathway maps are now integrated with network variation maps in the NETWORK database, as well as with conserved functional units of KEGG modules and reaction modules in the MODULE database.

"34174819","UniBind: maps of high-confidence direct TF-DNA interactions across nine species.","<h4>Background</h4>Transcription factors (TFs) bind specifically to TF binding sites (TFBSs) at cis-regulatory regions to control transcription. It is critical to locate these TF-DNA interactions to understand transcriptional regulation. Efforts to predict bona fide TFBSs benefit from the availability of experimental data mapping DNA binding regions of TFs (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing - ChIP-seq).<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we processed ~‚Äâ10,000 public ChIP-seq datasets from nine species to provide high-quality TFBS predictions. After quality control, it culminated with the prediction of ~‚Äâ56 million TFBSs with experimental and computational support for direct TF-DNA interactions for 644 TFs in >‚Äâ1000 cell lines and tissues. These TFBSs were used to predict >‚Äâ197,000 cis-regulatory modules representing clusters of binding events in the corresponding genomes. The high-quality of the TFBSs was reinforced by their evolutionary conservation, enrichment at active cis-regulatory regions, and capacity to predict combinatorial binding of TFs. Further, we confirmed that the cell type and tissue specificity of enhancer activity was correlated with the number of TFs with binding sites predicted in these regions. All the data is provided to the community through the UniBind database that can be accessed through its web-interface ( https://unibind.uio.no/ ), a dedicated RESTful API, and as genomic tracks. Finally, we provide an enrichment tool, available as a web-service and an R package, for users to find TFs with enriched TFBSs in a set of provided genomic regions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>UniBind is the first resource of its kind, providing the largest collection of high-confidence direct TF-DNA interactions in nine species.","https://unibind.uio.no/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""unibind"", ""uio"", ""no"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""unibind"", ""maps"", ""of"", """", ""confidence"", ""direct"", ""tf"", ""dna"", ""interactions"", ""across"", ""nine"", ""species"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>transcription"", ""factors"", ""tfs"", ""bind"", ""specificy"", ""to"", ""tf"", ""binding"", ""sites"", ""tfbss"", ""at"", ""cis"", ""regulatory"", ""regions"", ""control"", ""transcription"", ""it"", ""is"", ""critical"", ""locate"", ""se"", ""dna"", ""interactions"", ""underst"", ""transcriptional"", ""regulation"", ""efts"", ""predict"", ""bona"", ""fide"", ""benefit"", """", """", ""availability"", ""of"", ""experimental"", """", ""mapping"", ""chromatin"", ""immunoprecipitation"", ""followed"", ""by"", ""sequencing"", ""chip"", ""seq"",

By gathering publicly available sORF data, normalizing them and summarizing redundant information, we were able to identify a total of 1‚Äâ162‚Äâ675 unique sORFs. Despite the usual characterization of ORFs as short, upstream or downstream, there is currently no clear consensus regarding the definition of these categories. Thus, the data have been reprocessed using a normalized nomenclature. MetamORF enables new analyses at locus, gene, transcript and ORF levels, which should offer the possibility to address new questions regarding sORF functions in the future. The repository is available through an user-friendly web interface, allowing easy browsing, visualization, filtering over multiple criteria and export possibilities. sORFs can be searched starting from a gene, a transcript and an ORF ID, looking in a genome area or browsing the whole repository for a species.

"34225788","A global overview of genetically interpretable multimorbidities among common diseases in the UK Biobank.","<h4>Background</h4>Multimorbidities greatly increase the global health burdens, but the landscapes of their genetic risks have not been systematically investigated.<h4>Methods</h4>We used the hospital inpatient data of 385,335 patients in the UK Biobank to investigate the multimorbid relations among 439 common diseases. Post-GWAS analyses were performed to identify multimorbidity shared genetic risks at the genomic loci, network, as well as overall genetic architecture levels. We conducted network decomposition for the networks of genetically interpretable multimorbidities to detect the hub diseases and the involved molecules and functions in each module.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 11,285 multimorbidities among 439 common diseases were identified, and 46% of them were genetically interpretable at the loci, network, or overall genetic architecture levels. Multimorbidities affecting the same and different physiological systems displayed different patterns of the shared genetic components, with the former more likely to share loci-level genetic components while the latter more likely to share network-level genetic components. Moreover, both the loci- and network-level genetic components shared by multimorbidities converged on cell immunity, protein metabolism, and gene silencing.

Finally, we showcased how hub diseases mediating the multimorbidity modules could help provide useful insights for the genetic contributors of multimorbidities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results provide a systematic resource for understanding the genetic predispositions of multimorbidities and indicate that hub diseases and converged molecules and functions may be the key for treating multimorbidities.

However, there are no databases that have been constructed to provide an eQTL analysis between SNPs and piRNA expression. In this study, we collected genotyping and piRNA expression data for 10 997 samples across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Using linear regression cis-eQTL analysis with adjustment of appropriate covariates, we identified millions of SNP-piRNA pairs in tumor (76 924 831) and normal (24 431 061) tissues. Further, we performed differential expression and survival analyses, and linked the eQTLs to genome-wide association study (GWAS) data to comprehensively decipher the functional roles of identified cis-piRNA eQTLs.

Currently, studies in rice (Oryza sativa) have mainly focused on the identification of GVs, while the functional annotation of GVs has not yet been systematically carried out. Here we present a functional impact map of GVs in rice. We curated haplotype information of 17,397,026 GVs from sequencing data of 4,726 rice accessions. We quantitatively evaluated the effects of missense mutations in coding regions in each haplotype based on the conservation of amino acid residues and obtained the effects of 918,848 non-redundant missense GVs. We also generated high-quality chromatin accessibility (CA) data from six representative rice tissues and used these data to train deep convolutional neural network models to predict the impacts of 5,067,405 GVs for CA in regulatory regions. We characterized the functional properties and tissue specificity of the effects of GVs and found that large-effect GVs in coding and regulatory regions might be subject to selection in different directions. We finally demonstrated how the functional impact map could be used to prioritize the causal variants in mapping populations.

Fast, inclusive and adaptive methods are required for the heterogenous SARS-CoV-2 sequence data generated at an unprecedented rate.<h4>Results</h4>We present an updated version of the SARS-CoV-2 analysis module of our automated computational pipeline, Infectious Pathogen Detector (IPD) 2.0, to perform genomic analysis to understand the variability and dynamics of the virus. It adopts the recent clade nomenclature and demonstrates the clade prediction accuracy of 92.8%. IPD 2.0 also contains a SARS-CoV-2 updater module, allowing automatic upgrading of the variant database using genome sequences from GISAID. As a proof of principle, analyzing 208,911 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, we generate an extensive database of 2.58 million sample-wise variants. A comparative account of lineage-specific mutations in the newer SARS-CoV-2 strains emerging in the UK, South Africa and Brazil and data reported from India identify overlapping and lineages specific acquired mutations suggesting a repetitive convergent and adaptive evolution.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A novel and dynamic feature of the SARS-CoV-2 module of IPD 2.0 makes it a contemporary tool to analyze the diverse and growing genomic strains of the virus and serve as a vital tool to help facilitate rapid genomic surveillance in a population to identify variants involved in breakthrough infections.

"33382886","Creating a Metabolic Syndrome Research Resource using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.","Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is multifaceted. Risk factors include visceral adiposity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, hypertension and environmental stimuli. MetS leads to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke. Comparative studies, however, have identified heterogeneity in the pathology of MetS across groups though the etiology of these differences has yet to be elucidated. The Metabolic Syndrome Research Resource (MetSRR) described in this report is a curated database that provides access to MetS-associated biological and ancillary data and pools current and potential biomarkers of MetS extracted from relevant National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 1999-2016. Each potential biomarker was selected following the review of over 100 peer-reviewed articles. MetSRR includes 28 demographics, survey and known MetS-related variables, including 9 curated categorical variables and 42 potentially novel biomarkers. All measures are captured from over 90‚Äâ000 individuals. This biocuration effort provides increased access to curated MetS-related data and will serve as a hypothesis-generating tool to aid in novel biomarker discovery. In addition, MetSRR provides the ability to generate and export ethnic group-/race-, sex- and age-specific curated datasets, thus broadening participation in research efforts to identify clinically evaluative MetS biomarkers for disparate populations. Although there are other databases, such as BioM2MetDisease, designed to explore metabolic diseases through analysis of miRNAs and disease phenotypes, MetSRR is the only MetS-specific database designed to explore etiology of MetS across groups, through the biocuration of demographic, biological samples and biometric data.

"34032471","The Human Salivary Proteome Wiki: A Community-Driven Research Platform.","Saliva has become an attractive body fluid for on-site, remote, and real-time monitoring of oral and systemic health. At the same time, the scientific community needs a saliva-centered information platform that keeps pace with the rapid accumulation of new data and knowledge by annotating, refining, and updating the salivary proteome catalog. We developed the Human Salivary Proteome (HSP) Wiki as a public data platform for researching and retrieving custom-curated data and knowledge on the saliva proteome. The HSP Wiki is dynamically compiled and updated based on published saliva proteome studies and up-to-date protein reference records. It integrates a wide range of available information by funneling in data from established external protein, genome, transcriptome, and glycome databases. In addition, the HSP Wiki incorporates data from human disease-related studies. Users can explore the proteome of saliva simply by browsing the database, querying the available data, performing comparisons of data sets, and annotating existing protein entries using a simple, intuitive interface. The annotation process includes both user feedback and curator committee review to ensure the quality and validity of each entry. Here, we present the first overview of features and functions the HSP Wiki offers. As a saliva proteome-centric, publicly accessible database, the HSP Wiki will advance the knowledge of saliva composition and function in health and disease for users across a wide range of disciplines. As a community-based data- and knowledgebase, the HSP Wiki will serve as a worldwide platform to exchange salivary proteome information, inspire novel research ideas, and foster cross-discipline collaborations. The HSP Wiki will pave the way for harnessing the full potential of the salivary proteome for diagnosis, risk prediction, therapy of oral and systemic diseases, and preparedness for emerging infectious diseases.Database URL: https://salivaryproteome.nidcr.nih.gov/.","https://salivaryproteome.nidcr.nih.gov/.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""salivaryproteome"", ""nidcr"", ""nih"", ""gov"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""human"", ""salivary"", ""proteome"", ""wiki"", ""a"", ""munity"", ""driven"", ""research"", ""platm"")","c(""saliva"", """", ""bee"", ""an"", ""attractive"", ""body"", ""fluid"", """", ""on"", ""site"", ""remote"", """", ""real"", """", ""monitoring"", ""of"", ""oral"", ""systemic"", ""health"", ""at"", """", ""same"", ""scientific"", ""munity"", ""needs"", ""a"", ""centered"", ""inmation"", ""platm"", """", ""keeps"", ""pace"", """", ""rapid"", ""accumulation"", """", """", ""knowledge"", ""by"", ""anating"", ""refining"", ""updating"", ""salivary"", ""proteome"", ""catalog"", ""we"", ""developed"", ""human"", ""hsp"", ""wiki"", ""as"", ""public"", ""researching"",

"34046592","A map of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA structurome.","SARS-CoV-2 has exploded throughout the human population. To facilitate efforts to gain insights into SARS-CoV-2 biology and to target the virus therapeutically, it is essential to have a roadmap of likely functional regions embedded in its RNA genome. In this report, we used a bioinformatics approach, ScanFold, to deduce the <i>local</i> RNA structural landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 genome with the highest likelihood of being functional. We recapitulate previously-known elements of RNA structure and provide a model for the folding of an essential frameshift signal. Our results find that SARS-CoV-2 is greatly enriched in unusually stable and likely evolutionarily ordered RNA structure, which provides a large reservoir of potential drug targets for RNA-binding small molecules. Results are enhanced via the re-analyses of publicly-available genome-wide biochemical structure probing datasets that are broadly in agreement with our models. Additionally, ScanFold was updated to incorporate experimental data as constraints in the analysis to facilitate comparisons between ScanFold and other RNA modelling approaches. Ultimately, ScanFold was able to identify eight highly structured/conserved motifs in SARS-CoV-2 that agree with experimental data, without explicitly using these data. All results are made available via a public database (the RNAStructuromeDB: https://structurome.bb.iastate.edu/sars-cov-2) and model comparisons are readily viewable at https://structurome.bb.iastate.edu/sars-cov-2-global-model-comparisons.","c(""https://structurome.bb.iastate.edu/sars-cov-2)""","""https://structurome.bb.iastate.edu/sars-cov-2-global-model-comparisons."")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""c"", """", ""structurome"", ""bb"", ""iastate"", ""edu"", ""sars"", ""cov"", ""2"")","c("""", """", ""structurome"", ""bb"", ""iastate"", ""edu"", ""sars"", ""cov"", ""2"", ""global"", ""model"", ""parisons"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""a"", ""map"", ""of"", """", ""sars"", ""cov"", ""2"", """", ""structurome"")","c(""sars"", ""cov"", ""2"", """", ""exploded"", ""throughout"", """", ""human"", ""population"", ""to"", ""facilitate"", ""efts"", ""gain"", ""insights"", """", ""biology"", """", ""target"", ""virus"", ""rapeuticy"", ""it"", ""is"", ""essential"", """", ""a"", ""roadmap"", ""of"", ""likely"", ""functional"", ""regions"", ""embedded"", ""in"", """", """", ""genome"", """", ""report"", ""we"", """", ""bioinmatics"", ""approach"", ""sfold"", ""deduce"", ""<i>local<"", ""i>"", ""structural"", ""lscape"", """", ""est"", ""likelihood"", ""being"",

"33211864","FANTOM enters 20th year: expansion of transcriptomic atlases and functional annotation of non-coding RNAs.","The Functional ANnoTation Of the Mammalian genome (FANTOM) Consortium has continued to provide extensive resources in the pursuit of understanding the transcriptome, and transcriptional regulation, of mammalian genomes for the last 20 years. To share these resources with the research community, the FANTOM web-interfaces and databases are being regularly updated, enhanced and expanded with new data types. In recent years, the FANTOM Consortium's efforts have been mainly focused on creating new non-coding RNA datasets and resources. The existing FANTOM5 human and mouse miRNA atlas was supplemented with rat, dog, and chicken datasets. The sixth (latest) edition of the FANTOM project was launched to assess the function of human long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). From its creation until 2020, FANTOM6 has contributed to the research community a large dataset generated from the knock-down of 285 lncRNAs in human dermal fibroblasts; this is followed with extensive expression profiling and cellular phenotyping. Other updates to the FANTOM resource includes the reprocessing of the miRNA and promoter atlases of human, mouse and chicken with the latest reference genome assemblies.

"33401309","ADeditome provides the genomic landscape of A-to-I RNA editing in Alzheimer's disease.","A-to-I RNA editing, contributing to nearly 90% of all editing events in human, has been reported to involve in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its roles in brain development and immune regulation, such as the deficient editing of GluA2 Q/R related to cell death and memory loss. Currently, there are urgent needs for the systematic annotations of A-to-I RNA editing events in AD. Here, we built ADeditome, the annotation database of A-to-I RNA editing in AD available at https://ccsm.uth.edu/ADeditome, aiming to provide a resource and reference for functional annotation of A-to-I RNA editing in AD to identify therapeutically targetable genes in an individual. We detected 1676 363 editing sites in 1524 samples across nine brain regions from ROSMAP, MayoRNAseq and MSBB. For these editing events, we performed multiple functional annotations including identification of specific and disease stage associated editing events and the influence of editing events on gene expression, protein recoding, alternative splicing and miRNA regulation for all the genes, especially for AD-related genes in order to explore the pathology of AD. Combing all the analysis results, we found 108 010 and 26 168 editing events which may promote or inhibit AD progression, respectively. We also found 5582 brain region-specific editing events with potentially dual roles in AD across different brain regions. ADeditome will be a unique resource for AD and drug research communities to identify therapeutically targetable editing events. Significance: ADeditome is the first comprehensive resource of the functional genomics of individual A-to-I RNA editing events in AD, which will be useful for many researchers in the fields of AD pathology, precision medicine, and therapeutic researches.","https://ccsm.uth.edu/ADeditome",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""ccsm"", ""uth"", ""edu"", ""adeditome"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""adeditome"", ""provides"", """", ""genomic"", ""lscape"", ""of"", ""a"", ""to"", ""i"", """", ""editing"", ""in"", ""alzheimer"", ""s"", ""disease"")","c(""a"", ""to"", ""i"", """", ""editing"", ""contributing"", ""nearly"", ""90"", ""of"", """", ""events"", ""in"", ""human"", """", """", ""reported"", ""involve"", """", ""pathosis"", ""alzheimer"", ""s"", ""disease"", ""ad"", ""due"", """", ""roles"", ""brain"", ""development"", """", ""immune"", ""regulation"", """", ""as"", ""deficient"", ""glua2"", ""q"", ""r"", ""related"", """", ""death"", ""memory"", ""loss"", ""currently"", ""re"", """", ""urgent"", ""needs"", """", ""systematic"", ""anations"", """", ""we"", ""built"", ""adeditome"", ""anation"",

Yet, much of these biological data is still isolated in the text, figures, tables and supplementary materials of articles. As a result, biological information created at great expense is significantly underutilised. The protein motif biology field does not have sufficient resources to curate the corpus of motif-related literature and, to date, only a fraction of the available articles have been curated. In this study, we develop a set of tools and a web resource, 'articles.ELM', to rapidly identify the motif literature articles pertinent to a researcher's interest. At the core of the resource is a manually curated set of about 8000 motif-related articles. These articles are automatically annotated with a range of relevant biological data allowing in-depth search functionality. Machine-learning article classification is used to group articles based on their similarity to manually curated motif classes in the Eukaryotic Linear Motif resource. Articles can also be manually classified within the resource. The 'articles.ELM' resource permits the rapid and accurate discovery of relevant motif articles thereby improving the visibility of motif literature and simplifying the recovery of valuable biological insights sequestered within scientific articles.

"33843105","Sequence and evolutionary analysis of bacterial ribosomal S1 proteins.","The multi-domain bacterial S1 protein is the largest and most functionally important ribosomal protein of the 30S subunit, which interacts with both mRNA and proteins. The family of ribosomal S1 proteins differs in the classical sense from a protein with tandem repeats and has a ""bead-on-string"" organization, where each repeat is folded into a globular domain. Based on our recent data, the study of evolutionary relationships for the bacterial phyla will provide evidence for one of the proposed theories of the evolutionary development of proteins with structural repeats: from multiple repeats of assembles to single repeats, or vice versa.

The method allowed full-length mapping of RNA-seq reads, which facilitated comprehensive, unbiased characterization of alternative exon usage along the renal tubule, including known isoforms of <i>Cldn10</i>, <i>Kcnj1</i> (ROMK), <i>Slc12a1</i> (NKCC2), <i>Wnk1</i>, <i>Stk39</i> (SPAK), and <i>Slc14a2</i> (UT-A urea transporter). It also identified many novel isoforms with segment-specific distribution. These included variants associated with altered protein structure (<i>Slc9a8</i>, <i>Khk</i>, <i>Tsc22d1</i>, and <i>Scoc</i>), and variants that may affect untranslated, regulatory regions of transcripts (<i>Pth1r</i>, <i>Pkar1a</i>, and <i>Dab2</i>).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Full-length, unbiased sequencing of transcripts identified gene-expression patterns along the mouse renal tubule. The data, provided as an online resource, include both quantitative and qualitative differences in transcripts.

"33045737","INTEDE: interactome of drug-metabolizing enzymes.","Drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) are critical determinant of drug safety and efficacy, and the interactome of DMEs has attracted extensive attention. There are 3 major interaction types in an interactome: microbiome-DME interaction (MICBIO), xenobiotics-DME interaction (XEOTIC) and host protein-DME interaction (HOSPPI). The interaction data of each type are essential for drug metabolism, and the collective consideration of multiple types has implication for the future practice of precision medicine. However, no database was designed to systematically provide the data of all types of DME interactions. Here, a database of the Interactome of Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes (INTEDE) was therefore constructed to offer these interaction data. First, 1047 unique DMEs (448 host and 599 microbial) were confirmed, for the first time, using their metabolizing drugs. Second, for these newly confirmed DMEs, all types of their interactions (3359 MICBIOs between 225 microbial species and 185 DMEs; 47 778 XEOTICs between 4150 xenobiotics and 501 DMEs; 7849 HOSPPIs between 565 human proteins and 566 DMEs) were comprehensively collected and then provided, which enabled the crosstalk analysis among multiple types.

Here, we describe the development of a new statistical mining module, which permits several differential gene expression analyses, i.e. 'Expression' module. Sixty-two breast cancer cohorts and one healthy breast cohort with their corresponding clinicopathological information are included in bc-GenExMiner v4.5 version. Analyses are based on microarray or RNAseq transcriptomic data. Thirty-nine differential gene expression analyses, grouped into 13 categories, according to clinicopathological and molecular characteristics ('Targeted' and 'Exhaustive') and gene expression ('Customized'), have been developed. Output results are visualized in four forms of plots. This new statistical mining module offers, among other things, the possibility to compare gene expression in healthy (cancer-free), tumour-adjacent and tumour tissues at once and in three triple-negative breast cancer subtypes (i.e. C1: molecular apocrine tumours; C2: basal-like tumours infiltrated by immune suppressive cells and C3: basal-like tumours triggering an ineffective immune response). Several validation tests showed that bioinformatics process did not alter the pathobiological information contained in the source data.

"33757430","ATAV: a comprehensive platform for population-scale genomic analyses.","<h4>Background</h4>A common approach for sequencing studies is to do joint-calling and store variants of all samples in a single file. If new samples are continually added or controls are re-used for several studies, the cost and time required to perform joint-calling for each analysis can become prohibitive.<h4>Results</h4>We present ATAV, an analysis platform for large-scale whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing projects. ATAV stores variant and per site coverage data for all samples in a centralized database, which is efficiently queried by ATAV to support diagnostic analyses for trios and singletons, as well as rare-variant collapsing analyses for finding disease associations in complex diseases. Runtime logs ensure full reproducibility and the modularized ATAV framework makes it extensible to continuous development. Besides helping with the identification of disease-causing variants for a range of diseases, ATAV has also enabled the discovery of disease-genes by rare-variant collapsing on datasets containing more than 20,000 samples. Analyses to date have been performed on data of more than 110,000 individuals demonstrating the scalability of the framework. To allow users to easily access variant-level data directly from the database, we provide a web-based interface, the ATAV data browser ( http://atavdb.org/ ). Through this browser, summary-level data for more than 40,000 samples can be queried by the general public representing a mix of cases and controls of diverse ancestries. Users have access to phenotype categories of variant carriers, as well as predicted ancestry, gender, and quality metrics. In contrast to many other platforms, the data browser is able to show data of newly-added samples in real-time and therefore evolves rapidly as more and more samples are sequenced.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Through ATAV, users have public access to one of the largest variant databases for patients sequenced at a tertiary care center and can look up any genes or variants of interest. Additionally, since the entire code is freely available on GitHub, ATAV can easily be deployed by other groups that wish to build their own platform, database, and user interface.","http://atavdb.org/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""atavdb"", """")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""atav"", ""a"", ""prehensive"", ""platm"", """", ""population"", ""scale"", ""genomic"", ""analyses"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>a"", ""mon"", ""approach"", """", ""sequencing"", ""studies"", ""is"", ""to"", ""do"", ""joint"", ""cing"", """", ""store"", ""variants"", ""of"", """", ""samples"", ""in"", ""a"", ""single"", ""file"", ""if"", """", """", ""continuy"", ""added"", ""or"", ""controls"", ""re"", """", ""several"", """", ""cost"", """", ""required"", ""perm"", """", ""analysis"", """", ""bee"", ""prohibitive"", ""<h4>results<"", ""h4>we"", ""present"", ""atav"", ""an"", ""platm"", ""large"", ""scale"", ""whole"", ""exome"", ""genome"", ""projects"",

"32493955","WilsonGen a comprehensive clinically annotated genomic variant resource for Wilson's Disease.","Wilson disease (WD) is one of the most prevalent genetic diseases with an estimated global carrier frequency of 1 in 90 and a prevalence of 1 in 30,000. The disease owes its genesis to Kinnier Wilson who described the disease, and is caused by accumulation of Copper (Cu) in various organs including the liver, central nervous system, cornea, kidney, joints and cardiac muscle which contribute to the characteristic clinical features of WD. A number of studies have reported genetic variants in the ATP7B gene from diverse ethnic and geographical origins. The recent advent of next-generation sequencing approaches has also enabled the discovery of a large number of novel variants in the gene associated with the disease. Previous attempts have been made to compile the knowledgebase and spectrum of genetic variants from across the multitude of publications, but have been limited by the utility due to the significant differences in approaches used to qualify pathogenicity of variants in each of the publications. The recent formulation of guidelines and algorithms for assessment of the pathogenicity of variants jointly put forward by the American College of Medical Genetics and the Association of Molecular Pathologists (ACMG &AMP) has provided a framework for evidence based and systematic assessment of pathogenicity of variants. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive resource of genetic variants in ATP7B gene manually curated from literature and data resources and systematically annotated using the ACMG & AMP guidelines for assessing pathogenicity. The resource therefore serves as a central point for clinicians and geneticists working on WD and to the best of our knowledge is the most comprehensive and only clinically annotated resource for WD. The resource is available at URL http://clingen.igib.res.in/WilsonGen/. We compiled a total of 3662 genetic variants from publications and databases associated with WD. Of these variants compiled, a total of 1458 were found to be unique entries. This is the largest WD database comprising 656 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants reported classified according to ACMG & AMP guidelines.

Through pervasive infections of their cellular hosts, viruses can reshape microbial community structure and drive global nutrient cycling. Over the past decade, viral sequences identified from genomes and metagenomes have provided an unprecedented view of viral genome diversity in nature. Since 2016, the IMG/VR database has provided access to the largest collection of viral sequences obtained from (meta)genomes. Here, we present the third version of IMG/VR, composed of 18 373 cultivated and 2 314 329 uncultivated viral genomes (UViGs), nearly tripling the total number of sequences compared to the previous version. These clustered into 935 362 viral Operational Taxonomic Units (vOTUs), including 188 930 with two or more members.

"33166388","LegumeIP V3: from models to crops-an integrative gene discovery platform for translational genomics in legumes.","Legumes have contributed to human health, sustainable food and feed production worldwide for centuries. The study of model legumes has played vital roles in deciphering key genes, pathways, and networks regulating biological mechanisms and agronomic traits. Along with emerging breeding technology such as genome editing, translation of the knowledge gained from model plants to crops is in high demand. The updated database (V3) was redesigned for translational genomics targeting the discovery of novel key genes in less-studied non-model legume crops by referring to the knowledge gained in model legumes. The database contains genomic data for all 22 included species, and transcriptomic data covering thousands of RNA-seq samples mostly from model species. The rich biological data and analytic tools for gene expression and pathway analyses can be used to decipher critical genes, pathways, and networks in model legumes. The integrated comparative genomic functions further facilitate the translation of this knowledge to legume crops. Therefore, the database will be a valuable resource to identify important genes regulating specific biological mechanisms or agronomic traits in the non-model yet economically significant legume crops.

"34025934","Computational modeling and bioinformatic analyses of functional mutations in drug target genes in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>.","Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be the leading cause of deaths due to its persistent drug resistance and the consequent ineffectiveness of anti-TB treatment. Recent years witnessed huge amount of sequencing data, revealing mutations responsible for drug resistance. However, the lack of an up-to-date repository remains a barrier towards utilization of these data and identifying major mutations-associated with resistance. Amongst all mutations, non-synonymous mutations alter the amino acid sequence of a protein and have a much greater effect on pathogenicity. Hence, this type of gene mutation is of prime interest of the present study. The purpose of this study is to develop an updated database comprising almost all reported substitutions within the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>M.tb</i>) drug target genes <i>rpoB</i>, <i>inhA</i>, <i>katG</i>, <i>pncA</i>, <i>gyrA</i> and <i>gyrB.</i> Various bioinformatics prediction tools were used to assess the structural and biophysical impacts of the resistance causing non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) at the molecular level. This was followed by evaluating the impact of these mutations on binding affinity of the drugs to target proteins. We have developed a comprehensive online resource named MycoTRAP-DB (<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> Resistance Associated Polymorphisms Database) that connects mutations in genes with their structural, functional and pathogenic implications on protein. This database is accessible at http://139.59.12.92. This integrated platform would enable comprehensive analysis and prioritization of SNPs for the development of improved diagnostics and antimycobacterial medications.

The purpose of this study was to develop a machine-learning algorithm for the prediction of survival at five years for patients with MLS and externally validate it using our institutional cohort.<h4>Methods</h4>Two databases, the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results program (SEER) database and an institutional database, were used in this study. Five machine learning models were created based on the SEER database and performance was rated using the TRIPOD criteria. The model that performed best on the SEER data was again tested on our institutional database.<h4>Results</h4>The net-elastic penalized logistic regression model was the best according to our performance indicators.

It is freely available, and since its inception in 2015, the database has become an important resource to several studies. Its content has been: used as training data for machine learning models; incorporated to larger databases; and utilized in drug discovery studies for hit identifications.<h4>Description</h4>Here, we report the updated version of SANCDB. The new version includes 412 additional compounds that have been reported since 2015, giving a total of 1012 compounds in the database. Further, although natural products (NPs) are an important source of unique scaffolds, they have a major drawback due to their complex structure resulting in low synthetic feasibility in the laboratory. With this in mind, SANCDB is, now, updated to provide direct links to commercially available analogs from two major chemical databases namely Mcule and MolPort. To our knowledge, this feature is not available in other NP databases. Additionally, for easier access to information by users, the database and website interface were updated. The compounds are now downloadable in many different chemical formats.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The drug discovery process relies heavily on NPs due to their unique chemical organization. This has inspired the establishment of numerous NP chemical databases. With the emergence of newer chemoinformatic technologies, existing chemical databases require constant updates to facilitate information accessibility and integration by users. Besides increasing the NPs compound content, the updated SANCDB allows users to access the individual compounds (if available) or their analogs from commercial databases seamlessly.","https://sancdb.rubi.ru.ac.za/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""sancdb"", ""rubi"", ""ru"", ""ac"", ""za"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""sancdb"", ""an"", ""update"", ""on"", ""south"", ""afri"", ""natural"", ""pounds"", """", ""ir"", ""readily"", ""available"", ""analogs"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>south"", ""afri"", ""natural"", ""pounds"", ""base"", ""sancdb"", """", ""rubi"", ""ru"", ""ac"", ""za"", ""is"", """", ""sole"", """", ""a"", ""fully"", ""referenced"", ""of"", ""chemical"", ""south"", ""biodiversity"", ""it"", ""freely"", ""available"", ""since"", """", ""inception"", ""in"", ""2015"", """", ""bee"", ""an"", ""important"", ""resce"", ""to"", ""several"", ""studies"", ""content"", """", """", ""as"", ""training"", """", """", ""machine"", ""learning"", ""models"", ""incorporated"", ""larger"", ""bases"",

To overcome these problems, we upgraded our Plant Long noncoding RNA Database (PLncDB, http://plncdb.tobaccodb.org/), which was based on a uniform annotation pipeline. PLncDB V2.0 currently contains 1 246 372 lncRNAs for 80 plant species based on 13 834 RNA-Seq datasets, integrating lncRNA information from four other resources including EVLncRNAs, RNAcentral and etc. Expression patterns and epigenetic signals can be visualized using multiple tools (JBrowse, eFP Browser and EPexplorer). Targets and regulatory networks for lncRNAs are also provided for function exploration. In addition, PLncDB V2.0 is hierarchical and user-friendly and has five built-in search engines.

"33151298","GRNdb: decoding the gene regulatory networks in diverse human and mouse conditions.","Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) formed by transcription factors (TFs) and their downstream target genes play essential roles in gene expression regulation. Moreover, GRNs can be dynamic changing across different conditions, which are crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. However, no existing database provides comprehensive GRN information for various human and mouse normal tissues and diseases at the single-cell level. Based on the known TF-target relationships and the large-scale single-cell RNA-seq data collected from public databases as well as the bulk data of The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Genotype-Tissue Expression project, we systematically predicted the GRNs of 184 different physiological and pathological conditions of human and mouse involving >633 000 cells and >27 700 bulk samples. We further developed GRNdb, a freely accessible and user-friendly database (http://www.grndb.com/) for searching, comparing, browsing, visualizing, and downloading the predicted information of 77 746 GRNs, 19 687 841 TF-target pairs, and related binding motifs at single-cell/bulk resolution.

Yet, a systematic study on the switch in their interaction pattern between activation and suppression and between normal and cancer conditions based on multi-omics evidences is not available. We built miRactDB, a database for miRNA-gene interaction, at https://ccsm.uth.edu/miRactDB, to provide a versatile resource and platform for annotation and interpretation of miRNA-gene relations. We conducted a comprehensive investigation on miRNA-gene interactions and their biological implications across tissue types in both tumour and normal conditions, based on TCGA, CCLE and GTEx databases. We particularly explored the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms potentially contributing to the positive correlation, including identification of miRNA binding sites in the gene coding sequence (CDS) and promoter regions of partner genes. Integrative analysis based on this resource revealed that top-ranked genes derived from TCGA tumour and adjacent normal samples share an overwhelming part of biological processes, which are quite different than those from CCLE and GTEx. The most active miRNAs predicted to target CDS and promoter regions are largely overlapped. These findings corroborate that adjacent normal tissues might have undergone significant molecular transformations towards oncogenesis before phenotypic and histological change; and there probably exists a small yet critical set of miRNAs that profoundly influence various cancer hallmark processes. miRactDB provides a unique resource for the cancer and genomics communities to screen, prioritize and rationalize their candidates of miRNA-gene interactions, in both normal and cancer scenarios.","https://ccsm.uth.edu/miRactDB",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""ccsm"", ""uth"", ""edu"", ""miractdb"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""miractdb"", ""characterizes"", ""mi"", """", ""relation"", ""switch"", ""between"", ""normal"", """", ""cer"", ""tissues"", ""across"", ""pan"")","c(""it"", """", """", ""increasingly"", ""accepted"", """", ""micro"", ""mi"", """", """", ""activate"", """", ""suppress"", """", ""expression"", ""directly"", ""or"", ""indirectly"", ""under"", ""particular"", ""circumstances"", ""yet"", ""a"", ""systematic"", ""study"", ""on"", """", ""switch"", ""in"", ""ir"", ""interaction"", ""pattern"", ""between"", ""activation"", ""suppression"", ""normal"", ""cer"", ""conditions"", ""based"", ""multi"", ""omics"", ""evidences"", ""is"", """", ""available"", ""we"", ""built"", ""miractdb"", ""base"", """",

However, currently, there are no such online resources for large-scale collection, storage and analysis of TF-cancer associations in those cancers. To fill this gap, we present a database called TFcancer (http://lcbb.swjtu.edu.cn/tfcancer/), which contains 3136 experimentally supported associations between 364 TFs and 33 TCGA cancers by manually curating more than 1800 literature. TFcancer mainly concentrates on four aspects: TF expression, molecular alteration, regulatory relationships between TFs and target genes, and biological processes and signaling pathways of TFs in cancers. TFcancer not only provides a user-friendly interface for browsing and searching but also allows flexible data downloading and user data submitting.

"33984507","HisPhosSite: A comprehensive database of histidine phosphorylated proteins and sites.","Histidine phosphorylation is critically important in a variety of cellular processes including signal transduction, cell cycle, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is estimated to account for 6% of all phosphorylated amino acids. However, due to the acid lability of the PN bond, the study of pHis lags far behind that of pSer, pThr, and pTyr. Recently, the development and use of pHis-specific antibodies and methodologies have led to a resurgence in the study of histidine phosphorylation. Although a considerable number of pHis proteins and sites have been discovered, most of them have not been manually curated and integrated to any databases. There is a lack of a data repository for pHis, and such work is expected to help further systemic studies of pHis. Thus, we present a comprehensive resource database of histidine phosphorylation (HisPhosSite) by curating experimentally validated pHis proteins and sites and compiling putative pHis sites with ortholog search. HisPhosSite contains 776 verified pHis sites and 2702 verified pHis proteins in 38 eukaryotic and prokaryotic species and 15,378 putative pHis sites and 10,816 putative pHis proteins in 1366 species. HisPhosSite provides rich annotations of pHis sites and proteins and multiple search engines (including motif search and BLAST search) for users to locate pHis sites of interest. HisPhosSite is available at http://reprod.njmu.edu.cn/hisphossite. SIGNIFICANCE: Histidine phosphorylation is involved in a variety of cellular processes as well as cancers, and it has been proved to be more common than previously thought. The HisPhosSite database was developed to collect pHis data from published literatures with experimental evidences.

"33929905","Risk-Based Chemical Ranking and Generating a Prioritized Human Exposome Database.","<h4>Background</h4>Due to the ubiquitous use of chemicals in modern society, humans are increasingly exposed to thousands of chemicals that contribute to a major portion of the human exposome. Should a comprehensive and risk-based human exposome database be created, it would be conducive to the rapid progress of human exposomics research. In addition, once a xenobiotic is biotransformed with distinct half-lives upon exposure, monitoring the parent compounds alone may not reflect the actual human exposure. To address these questions, a comprehensive and risk-prioritized human exposome database is needed.<h4>Objectives</h4>Our objective was to set up a comprehensive risk-prioritized human exposome database including physicochemical properties as well as risk prediction and develop a graphical user interface (GUI) that has the ability to conduct searches for content associated with chemicals in our database.<h4>Methods</h4>We built a comprehensive risk-prioritized human exposome database by text mining and database fusion. Subsequently, chemicals were prioritized by integrating exposure level obtained from the Systematic Empirical Evaluation of Models with toxicity data predicted by the Toxicity Estimation Software Tool and the Toxicological Priority Index calculated from the ToxCast database. The biotransformation half-lives (HLBs) of all the chemicals were assessed using the Iterative Fragment Selection approach and biotransformation products were predicted using the previously developed BioTransformer machine-learning method.<h4>Results</h4>We compiled a human exposome database of >20,000 chemicals, prioritized 13,441 chemicals based on probabilistic hazard quotient and 7,770 chemicals based on risk index, and provided a predicted biotransformation metabolite database of >95,000 metabolites. In addition, a user-interactive Java software (Oracle)-based search GUI was generated to enable open access to this new resource.<h4>Discussion</h4>Our database can be used to guide chemical management and enhance scientific understanding to rapidly and effectively prioritize chemicals for comprehensive biomonitoring in epidemiological investigations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7722.","https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7722.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""doi"", """", ""10"", ""1289"", ""ehp7722"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""risk"", ""based"", ""chemical"", ""ranking"", """", ""rating"", ""a"", ""prioritized"", ""human"", ""exposome"", ""base"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>due"", ""to"", """", ""ubiquitous"", """", ""of"", ""chemicals"", ""in"", ""modern"", ""society"", ""humans"", """", ""increasingly"", ""exposed"", ""thouss"", """", ""contribute"", ""a"", ""major"", ""portion"", ""human"", ""exposome"", ""should"", ""prehensive"", """", ""risk"", ""based"", ""base"", ""be"", ""created"", ""it"", ""would"", ""conducive"", ""rapid"", ""progress"", ""exposomics"", ""research"", ""addition"", ""once"", ""xenobiotic"", ""is"", ""biotransmed"", """", ""distinct"", ""half"", ""lives"", ""upon"", ""exposure"",

The accumulation of metagenomic sequencing studies enables us to better understand the temporal and spatial variations of the gut microbiota under different physiological and pathological conditions.

"33119751","The MemMoRF database for recognizing disordered protein regions interacting with cellular membranes.","Protein and lipid membrane interactions play fundamental roles in a large number of cellular processes (e.g. signalling, vesicle trafficking, or viral invasion). A growing number of examples indicate that such interactions can also rely on intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs), which can form specific reversible interactions not only with proteins but also with lipids. We named IDRs involved in such membrane lipid-induced disorder-to-order transition as MemMoRFs, in an analogy to IDRs exhibiting disorder-to-order transition upon interaction with protein partners termed Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs). Currently, both the experimental detection and computational characterization of MemMoRFs are challenging, and information about these regions are scattered in the literature. To facilitate the related investigations we generated a comprehensive database of experimentally validated MemMoRFs based on manual curation of literature and structural data. To characterize the dynamics of MemMoRFs, secondary structure propensity and flexibility calculated from nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts were incorporated into the database. These data were supplemented by inclusion of sentences from papers, functional data and disease-related information.

Although numerous attempts and numerous databases have been made to manage these data, a platform that incorporates all the heterogeneous data collected from stem cell projects into a harmonized project-based framework is still lacking. The aim of the database, which is described in this study, is to provide an intelligent informatics solution that integrates comprehensive characterization of diverse stem cell product characteristics with research subject and project outcome information. In the resulting platform, heterogeneous data are validated using predefined ontologies and stored in a relational database, to ensure data quality and ease of access. Testing was performed using 51 published, publically available induced pluripotent stem cell projects conducted in clinical, preclinical and in-vitro evaluations. Future aims of this project include further increasing the database size to include all published stem cell trials and develop additional data visualization tools to improve usability. Our testing demonstrated the robustness of the proposed platform, by seamlessly harmonizing diverse common data elements, and the potential of this platform for driving knowledge generation from the aggregation and harmonization of these diverse data.<h4>Database url</h4>https://remedy.mssm.edu/.","https://remedy.mssm.edu/.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""remedy"", ""mssm"", ""edu"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""remedy"", ""a"", ""platm"", """", ""integrating"", """", ""sharing"", ""published"", ""stem"", """", ""research"", """", """", ""focus"", ""on"", ""ipsc"", ""trials"")","c(""<h4>abstract<"", ""h4>recent"", ""rerative"", ""medicine"", ""studies"", """", ""empized"", """", ""need"", """", ""increased"", ""stardization"", ""harmonization"", """", ""sharing"", ""of"", ""inmation"", ""related"", ""to"", ""stem"", """", ""product"", ""characterization"", ""help"", ""drive"", ""se"", ""innovative"", ""interventions"", ""toward"", ""public"", ""availability"", ""increase"", ""collaboration"", ""in"", ""scientific"", ""munity"", ""although"", ""numerous"", ""attempts"", ""bases"", """", ""made"", ""manage"", """",

The new database, CLRP_EPv2, consists of newly calculated three-dimensional (3D) dose distributions for 17 plaques [eight COMS, five Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG, and four others representative of models used worldwide] for <sup>103</sup> Pd, <sup>125</sup> I, and <sup>131</sup> Cs seeds.<h4>Acquisition and validation methods</h4>Plaque models are developed with egs_brachy, based on published/manufacturer dimensions and material data. The BEBIG plaques (modeled for the first time) are identical in dimensions to COMS plaques but differ in elemental composition and/or density. Previously benchmarked seed models are used. Eye plaques and seeds are simulated at the center of full-scatter water phantoms, scoring in (0.05 cm)<sup>3</sup> voxels spanning the eye for scenarios: (a) ""HOMO"": simulated TG43 conditions; (b) ""HETERO"": eye plaques and seeds fully modeled; (c) ""HETsi"" (BEBIG only): one seed is active at a time with other seed geometries present but not emitting photons (inactive); summation over all i seeds in a plaque then yields ""HETsum"" (includes interseed effects). For validation, doses are compared to those from CLRP_EPv1 and published data.<h4>Data format and access</h4>Data are available at https://physics.carleton.ca/clrp/eye_plaque_v2, http://doi.org/10.22215/clrp/EPv2. The data consist of 3D dose distributions (text-based EGSnrc ""3ddose"" file format) and graphical presentations of the comparisons to previously published data.<h4>Potential applications</h4>The CLRP_EPv2 database provides accurate reference 3D dose distributions to advance ocular brachytherapy dose evaluations. The fully-benchmarked eye plaque models will be freely distributed with egs_brachy, supporting adoption of model-based dose evaluations as recommended by TG-129, TG-186, and TG-221.","c(""https://physics.carleton.ca/clrp/eye_plaque_v2","""","""http://doi.org/10.22215/clrp/EPv2."")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""c"", """", ""physics"", ""carleton"", ""ca"", ""clrp"", ""eye"", ""plaque"", ""v2"")","","c("""", """", ""doi"", """", ""10"", ""22215"", ""clrp"", ""epv2"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""update"", ""of"", """", ""clrp"", ""eye"", ""plaque"", ""brachyrapy"", ""base"", """", ""photon"", ""emitting"", ""sces"")","c(""<h4>purpose<"", ""h4>to"", ""update"", """", ""extend"", """", ""carleton"", ""laboratory"", """", ""radiorapy"", ""physics"", ""clrp"", ""eye"", ""plaque"", ""ep"", ""dosimetry"", ""base"", ""low"", ""energy"", ""photon"", ""emitting"", ""brachyrapy"", ""sces"", ""using"", ""egs"", ""brachy"", ""an"", ""open"", ""sce"", ""egsnrc"", ""application"", ""previous"", ""epv1"", ""contained"", ""s"", ""collaborative"", ""ocular"", ""melanoma"", ""study"", ""s"", ""plaques"", ""10"", ""22"", ""mm"", ""diameter"", """", ""<sup>103<"", ""sup>"", ""pd"", ""or"",

"33252190","GRIN database: A unified and manually curated repertoire of GRIN variants.","Glutamatergic neurotransmission is crucial for brain development, wiring neuronal function, and synaptic plasticity mechanisms. Recent genetic studies showed the existence of autosomal dominant de novo GRIN gene variants associated with GRIN-related disorders (GRDs), a rare pediatric neurological disorder caused by N-methyl- d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction. Notwithstanding, GRIN variants identification is exponentially growing and their clinical, genetic, and functional annotations remain highly fragmented, representing a bottleneck in GRD patient's stratification. To shorten the gap between GRIN variant identification and patient stratification, we present the GRIN database (GRINdb), a publicly available, nonredundant, updated, and curated database gathering all available genetic, functional, and clinical data from more than 4000 GRIN variants. The manually curated GRINdb outputs on a web server, allowing query and retrieval of reported GRIN variants, and thus representing a fast and reliable bioinformatics resource for molecular clinical advice. Furthermore, the comprehensive mapping of GRIN variants' genetic and clinical information along NMDAR structure revealed important differences in GRIN variants' pathogenicity and clinical phenotypes, shedding light on GRIN-specific fingerprints.

"32392583","M6A2Target: a comprehensive database for targets of m6A writers, erasers and readers.","N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant posttranscriptional modification in mammalian mRNA molecules and has a crucial function in the regulation of many fundamental biological processes. The m6A modification is a dynamic and reversible process regulated by a series of writers, erasers and readers (WERs). Different WERs might have different functions, and even the same WER might function differently in different conditions, which are mostly due to different downstream genes being targeted by the WERs. Therefore, identification of the targets of WERs is particularly important for elucidating this dynamic modification. However, there is still no public repository to host the known targets of WERs. Therefore, we developed the m6A WER target gene database (m6A2Target) to provide a comprehensive resource of the targets of m6A WERs. M6A2Target provides a user-friendly interface to present WER targets in two different modules: 'Validated Targets', referred to as WER targets identified from low-throughput studies, and 'Potential Targets', including WER targets analyzed from high-throughput studies.

"33780471","MCPdb: The bacterial microcompartment database.","Bacterial microcompartments are organelle-like structures composed entirely of proteins. They have evolved to carry out several distinct and specialized metabolic functions in a wide variety of bacteria. Their outer shell is constructed from thousands of tessellating protein subunits, encapsulating enzymes that carry out the internal metabolic reactions. The shell proteins are varied, with single, tandem and permuted versions of the PF00936 protein family domain comprising the primary structural component of their polyhedral architecture, which is reminiscent of a viral capsid. While considerable amounts of structural and biophysical data have been generated in the last 15 years, the existing functionalities of current resources have limited our ability to rapidly understand the functional and structural properties of microcompartments (MCPs) and their diversity.

VARAdb provides annotation information for 577,283,813 variations and novel variants, prioritizes variations based on scores using nine annotation categories, and supports pathway downstream analysis. Importantly, VARAdb integrates a large amount of genetic and epigenomic data into five annotation sections, which include 'Variation information', 'Regulatory information', 'Related genes', 'Chromatin accessibility' and 'Chromatin interaction'.

"33068433","CovalentInDB: a comprehensive database facilitating the discovery of covalent inhibitors.","Inhibitors that form covalent bonds with their targets have traditionally been considered highly adventurous due to their potential off-target effects and toxicity concerns. However, with the clinical validation and approval of many covalent inhibitors during the past decade, design and discovery of novel covalent inhibitors have attracted increasing attention. A large amount of scattered experimental data for covalent inhibitors have been reported, but a resource by integrating the experimental information for covalent inhibitor discovery is still lacking. In this study, we presented Covalent Inhibitor Database (CovalentInDB), the largest online database that provides the structural information and experimental data for covalent inhibitors. CovalentInDB contains 4511 covalent inhibitors (including 68 approved drugs) with 57 different reactive warheads for 280 protein targets. The crystal structures of some of the proteins bound with a covalent inhibitor are provided to visualize the protein-ligand interactions around the binding site. Each covalent inhibitor is annotated with the structure, warhead, experimental bioactivity, physicochemical properties, etc. Moreover, CovalentInDB provides the covalent reaction mechanism and the corresponding experimental verification methods for each inhibitor towards its target.

The input of the pipeline consists of epigenetic information sourced from the Encode database; the output consists of the trajectories of chromosomal motions that accurately predict Hi-C and fluorescence insitu hybridization data, as well as multiple observations of chromosomal dynamics in vivo. As an intermediate step, users can also generate chromosomal sub-compartment annotations directly from the same epigenetic input, without the use of any DNA-DNA proximity ligation data. Additionally, the NDB freely hosts both experimental and computational structural genomics data. Besides being able to perform their own genome simulations and download the hosted data, users can also analyze and visualize the same data through custom-designed web-based tools. In particular, the one-dimensional genetic and epigenetic data can be overlaid onto accurate 3D structures of chromosomes, to study the spatial distribution of genetic and epigenetic features.

"33515030","HVIDB: a comprehensive database for human-virus protein-protein interactions.","While leading to millions of people's deaths every year the treatment of viral infectious diseases remains a huge public health challenge.Therefore, an in-depth understanding of human-virus protein-protein interactions (PPIs) as the molecular interface between a virus and its host cell is of paramount importance to obtain new insights into the pathogenesis of viral infections and development of antiviral therapeutic treatments. However, current human-virus PPI database resources are incomplete, lack annotation and usually do not provide the opportunity to computationally predict human-virus PPIs. Here, we present the Human-Virus Interaction DataBase (HVIDB, http://zzdlab.com/hvidb/) that provides comprehensively annotated human-virus PPI data as well as seamlessly integrates online PPI prediction tools. Currently, HVIDB highlights 48 643 experimentally verified human-virus PPIs covering 35 virus families, 6633 virally targeted host complexes, 3572 host dependency/restriction factors as well as 911 experimentally verified/predicted 3D complex structures of human-virus PPIs. Furthermore, our database resource provides tissue-specific expression profiles of 6790 human genes that are targeted by viruses and 129 Gene Expression Omnibus series of differentially expressed genes post-viral infections. Based on these multifaceted and annotated data, our database allows the users to easily obtain reliable information about PPIs of various human viruses and conduct an in-depth analysis of their inherent biological significance. In particular, HVIDB also integrates well-performing machine learning models to predict interactions between the human host and viral proteins that are based on (i) sequence embedding techniques, (ii) interolog mapping and (iii) domain-domain interaction inference. We anticipate that HVIDB will serve as a one-stop knowledge base to further guide hypothesis-driven experimental efforts to investigate human-virus relationships.","http://zzdlab.com/hvidb/)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""zzdlab"", """", ""hvidb"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""hvidb"", ""a"", ""prehensive"", ""base"", """", ""human"", ""virus"", ""protein"", ""interactions"")","c(""while"", ""leading"", ""to"", ""millions"", ""of"", ""people"", ""s"", ""deaths"", ""every"", ""year"", """", ""treatment"", ""viral"", ""infectious"", ""diseases"", ""remains"", ""a"", ""huge"", ""public"", ""health"", ""chenge"", ""ree"", ""an"", ""in"", ""depth"", ""understing"", ""human"", ""virus"", ""protein"", ""interactions"", ""ppis"", ""as"", ""molecular"", ""interface"", ""between"", """", """", ""host"", """", ""is"", ""paramount"", ""importance"", ""obtain"", """", ""insights"", """", ""pathosis"", ""infections"", ""development"", ""antiviral"",

"32829394","Reanalysis of genome sequences of tomato accessions and its wild relatives: development of Tomato Genomic Variation (TGV) database integrating SNPs and INDELs polymorphisms.","<h4>Motivation</h4>Facilitated by technological advances and expeditious decrease in the sequencing costs, whole-genome sequencing is increasingly implemented to uncover variations in cultivars/accessions of many crop plants. In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), the availability of the genome sequence, followed by the resequencing of tomato cultivars and its wild relatives, has provided a prodigious resource for the improvement of traits. A high-quality genome resequencing of 84 tomato accessions and wild relatives generated a dataset that can be used as a resource to identify agronomically important alleles across the genome. Converting this dataset into a searchable database, including information about the influence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on protein function, provides valuable information about the genetic variations. The database will assist in searching for functional variants of a gene for introgression into tomato cultivars.<h4>Results</h4>A recent release of better-quality tomato genome reference assembly SL3.0, and new annotation ITAG3.2 of SL3.0, dropped 3857 genes, added 4900 novel genes and updated 20 766 genes. Using the above version, we remapped the data from the tomato lines resequenced under the '100 tomato genome resequencing project' on new tomato genome assembly SL3.0 and made an online searchable Tomato Genomic Variations (TGVs) database. The TGV contains information about SNPs and insertion/deletion events and expands it by functional annotation of variants with new ITAG3.2 using SIFT4G software. This database with search function assists in inferring the influence of SNPs on the function of a target gene. This database can be used for selecting SNPs, which can be potentially deployed for improving tomato traits.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>TGV is freely available at http://psd.uohyd.ac.in/tgv.","http://psd.uohyd.ac.in/tgv.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""psd"", ""uohyd"", ""ac"", ""in"", ""tgv"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""reanalysis"", ""of"", ""genome"", ""sequences"", ""tomato"", ""accessions"", """", """", ""wild"", ""relatives"", ""development"", ""genomic"", ""variation"", ""tgv"", ""base"", ""integrating"", ""snps"", ""indels"", ""polymorphisms"")","c(""<h4>motivation<"", ""h4>facilitated"", ""by"", ""technological"", ""advances"", """", ""expeditious"", ""decrease"", ""in"", """", ""sequencing"", ""costs"", ""whole"", ""genome"", ""is"", ""increasingly"", ""implemented"", ""to"", ""unc"", ""variations"", ""cultivars"", ""accessions"", ""of"", ""many"", ""crop"", ""plants"", ""tomato"", ""solanum"", ""lycopersicum"", ""availability"", ""sequence"", ""followed"", ""resequencing"", """", ""wild"", ""relatives"", """", ""provided"", ""a"", ""prodigious"", ""resce"", """", ""improvement"", ""tra"", """",

Outcomes were extracted from Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves reported in 153 oncology Phase III clinical trial publications identified through a PubMed search of clinical trials in breast, lung, prostate and colorectal cancer, published between 2014 and 2016. For each trial that met our search criteria, we curated study-level information and digitized all reported KM curves with the software Digitizelt. We then used the digitized KM survival curves to estimate (possibly censored) patient-level time-to-event outcomes. Collections of time-to-event datasets from completed trials can be used to support the choice of appropriate trial designs for future clinical studies. Patient-level data allow investigators to tailor clinical trial designs to diseases and classes of treatments.

The generation of a rich genome-to-phenome resource and supporting informatic infrastructure advances the scope of comparative genomics and furthers the understanding of functional elements. The project also provides terrestrial and aquatic animal agriculture community powerful resources for supporting improvements to farmed animal production, disease resistance, and genetic diversity. The FAANG Data Portal (https://data.faang.org) ensures Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) open access to the wealth of sample, sequencing, and analysis data produced by an ever-growing number of FAANG consortia. It is developed and maintained by the FAANG Data Coordination Centre (DCC) at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory's European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI). FAANG projects produce a standardised set of multi-omic assays with resulting data placed into a range of specialised open data archives. To ensure this data is easily findable and accessible by the community, the portal automatically identifies and collates all submitted FAANG data into a single easily searchable resource. The Data Portal supports direct download from the multiple underlying archives to enable seamless access to all FAANG data from within the portal itself. The portal provides a range of predefined filters, powerful predictive search, and a catalogue of sampling and analysis protocols and automatically identifies publications associated with any dataset. To ensure all FAANG data submissions are high-quality, the portal includes powerful contextual metadata validation and data submissions brokering to the underlying EMBL-EBI archives.

"34042771","Introducing a Platform for Integrating and Sharing Stem Cell Research Data.","Advancements in regenerative medicine have highlighted the need for increased standardization and sharing of stem cell products to help drive these innovative interventions toward public availability and to increase collaboration in the scientific community. Although numerous attempts and numerous databases have been made to store this data, there is still a lack of a platform that incorporates heterogeneous stem cell information into a harmonized project-based framework. The aim of the platform described in this study, ReMeDy, is to provide an intelligent informatics solution which integrates diverse stem cell product characteristics with study subject and omics information. In the resulting platform, heterogeneous data is validated using predefined ontologies and stored in a relational database. In this initial feasibility study, testing of the ReMeDy functionality was performed using published, publically-available induced pluripotent stem cell projects conducted in in vitro, preclinical and intervention evaluations. It demonstrated the robustness of ReMeDy for storing diverse iPSC data, by seamlessly harmonizing diverse common data elements, and the potential utility of this platform for driving knowledge generation from the aggregation of this shared data. Next steps include increasing the number of curated projects by developing a crowdsourcing framework for data upload and an automated pipeline for metadata abstraction.

"32591816","ExoBCD: a comprehensive database for exosomal biomarker discovery in breast cancer.","Effective and safe implementation of precision oncology for breast cancer is a vital strategy to improve patient outcomes, which relies on the application of reliable biomarkers. As 'liquid biopsy' and novel resource for biomarkers, exosomes provide a promising avenue for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Although several exosome-related databases have been developed, there is still lacking of an integrated database for exosome-based biomarker discovery. To this end, a comprehensive database ExoBCD (https://exobcd.liumwei.org) was constructed with the combination of robust analysis of four high-throughput datasets, transcriptome validation of 1191 TCGA cases and manual mining of 950 studies. In ExoBCD, approximately 20 900 annotation entries were integrated from 25 external sources and 306 exosomal molecules (49 potential biomarkers and 257 biologically interesting molecules). The latter could be divided into 3 molecule types, including 121 mRNAs, 172 miRNAs and 13 lncRNAs. Thus, the well-linked information about molecular characters, experimental biology, gene expression patterns, overall survival, functional evidence, tumour stage and clinical use were fully integrated. As a data-driven and literature-based paradigm proposed of biomarker discovery, this study also demonstrated the corroborative analysis and identified 36 promising molecules, as well as the most promising prognostic biomarkers, IGF1R and FRS2. Taken together, ExoBCD is the first well-corroborated knowledge base for exosomal studies of breast cancer.

Protein tandem repeats are ubiquitous in all branches of the tree of life. The accumulation of solved repeat structures provides new possibilities for classification and detection, but also increasing the need for annotation. Here we present RepeatsDB 3.0, which addresses these challenges and presents an extended classification scheme. The major conceptual change compared to the previous version is the hierarchical classification combining top levels based solely on structural similarity (Class > Topology > Fold) with two new levels (Clan > Family) requiring sequence similarity and describing repeat motifs in collaboration with Pfam. Data growth has been addressed with improved mechanisms for browsing the classification hierarchy. A new UniProt-centric view unifies the increasingly frequent annotation of structures from identical or similar sequences.

The database can be created with either protein or nucleotide sequences containing all entries or complete genomes only. The pipeline can automatically clean the database by removing entries with matches to a database of user-specified sequence contaminants. The default contamination entries include sequences from the UniVec database of plasmids, marker genes and sequencing adapters from NCBI, an E.coli genome, rRNA sequences, vectors and satellite sequences. Furthermore, duplicates are removed and the database is automatically screened for sequences from green fluorescent protein, luciferase and antibiotic resistance genes that might be present in some GenBank viral entries, and could lead to false positives in virus identification. For utilizing the database, we present a useful opportunity for dealing with possible human contamination. We show the applicability of DONE by downloading a virus database comprising 37 virus families. We observed an average increase of 16 776 new entries downloaded per month for the 37 families.

"33882119","BC-TFdb: a database of transcription factor drivers in breast cancer.","Transcription factors (TFs) are DNA-binding proteins, which regulate many essential biological functions. In several cancer types, TF function is altered by various direct mechanisms, including gene amplification or deletion, point mutations, chromosomal translocations, expression alterations, as well as indirectly by non-coding DNA mutations influencing the binding of the TF. TFs are also actively involved in breast cancer (BC) initiation and progression. Herein, we have developed an open-access database, BC-TFdb (Breast Cancer Transcription Factors database), of curated, non-redundant TF involved in BC. The database provides BC driver TFs related information including genomic sequences, proteomic sequences, structural data, pathway information, mutations information, DNA binding residues, survival and therapeutic resources. The database will be a useful platform for researchers to obtain BC-related TF-specific information.

"33985427","TarDB: an online database for plant miRNA targets and miRNA-triggered phased siRNAs.","<h4>Background</h4>In plants, microRNAs (miRNAs) are pivotal regulators of plant development and stress responses. Different computational tools and web servers have been developed for plant miRNA target prediction; however, in silico prediction normally contains false positive results. In addition, many plant miRNA target prediction servers lack information for miRNA-triggered phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs). Creating a comprehensive and relatively high-confidence plant miRNA target database is much needed.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we report TarDB, an online database that collects three categories of relatively high-confidence plant miRNA targets: (i) cross-species conserved miRNA targets; (ii) degradome/PARE (Parallel Analysis of RNA Ends) sequencing supported miRNA targets; (iii) miRNA-triggered phasiRNA loci. TarDB provides a user-friendly interface that enables users to easily search, browse and retrieve miRNA targets and miRNA initiated phasiRNAs in a broad variety of plants. TarDB has a comprehensive collection of reliable plant miRNA targets containing previously unreported miRNA targets and miRNA-triggered phasiRNAs even in the well-studied model species. Most of these novel miRNA targets are relevant to lineage-specific or species-specific miRNAs.

The biomarker has become a significant topic due to its versatile usage in the medical field and in rapid detection of the presence or severity of some diseases. The volume of biomarker data is rapidly increasing and the identified data are scattered. To provide comprehensive information, the explosively growing data need to be recorded in a single platform. There is no open-source freely available comprehensive online biomarker database. To fulfill this purpose, we have developed a human biomarker database as part of the KNApSAcK family databases which contain a vast quantity of information on the relationships between biomarkers and diseases. We have classified the diseases into 18 disease classes, mostly according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information definitions. Apart from this database development, we also have performed disease classification by separately using protein and metabolite biomarkers based on the network clustering algorithm DPClusO and hierarchical clustering. Finally, we reached a conclusion about the relationships among the disease classes. The human biomarker database can be accessed online and the inter-disease relationships may be helpful in understanding the molecular mechanisms of diseases.

"32766766","LncR2metasta: a manually curated database for experimentally supported lncRNAs during various cancer metastatic events.","Mounting evidence has shown the involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) during various cancer metastatic events (abbreviated as CMEs, e.g. cancer cell invasion, intravasation, extravasation, proliferation, etc.) that may cooperatively facilitate malignant tumor spread and cause massive patient deaths. The study of lncRNA-CME associations might help understand lncRNA functions in metastasis and present reliable biomarkers for early dissemination detection and optimized treatment. Therefore, we developed a database named 'lncR2metasta' by manually compiling experimentally supported lncRNAs during various CMEs from existing studies. LncR2metasta documents 1238 associations between 304 lncRNAs and 39 CMEs across 54 human cancer subtypes. Each entry of lncR2metasta contains detailed information on a lncRNA-CME association, including lncRNA symbol, a specific CME, brief description of the association, lncRNA category, lncRNA Entrez or Ensembl ID, lncRNA genomic location and strand, lncRNA experiment, lncRNA expression pattern, detection method, target gene (or pathway) of lncRNA, lncRNA regulatory role on a CME, cancer name and the literature reference. An easy-to-use web interface was deployed in lncR2metasta for its users to easily browse, search and download as well as to submit novel lncRNA-CME associations.

"34000890","The hospital telemedicine TELEMED database: Providing information on evidence-based telemedicine services to hospital managers and healthcare professionals.","<h4>Background</h4>Increased use of telemedicine in the healthcare system is a political goal in Denmark. Although the number of hospital patients using interventions such as the video consultation has increased in recent years only a small proportion of the outpatient and inpatient visits involve telemedicine. The TELEMED database (https://telemedicine.cimt.dk/) has been launched at the Center for Innovative Medical Technology in Denmark to ensure that hospital managers and healthcare professionals have access to information about telemedicine services and their effectiveness. This article describes the development and the content of the TELEMED database.<h4>Methods</h4>A structured literature search was made in the PubMed Database for randomised controlled trials or observational studies with a control group that investigated the effect of telemedicine interventions for hospital patients. Data were extracted from each article on the clinical effectiveness, patient perceptions, economic effects and implementation challenges. As the database should only provide inspiration to healthcare professionals regarding possibilities for use of telemedicine, the risk of bias in the studies was not assessed.<h4>Results</h4>The literature search resulted in 2825 hits. Based on full text assessment, 331 articles were included for data extraction and assessment. These articles present telemedicine services used in 22 different medical specialities. Forty-eight percent of the studies found a positive, statistically significant clinical effect, while 47% showed no statistically significant difference. In 48% of the studies, patients' experiences were examined and of these 68% found positive patient experiences. Fifty-four percent of the articles included information on the economic effects and, of these, 51% found reduction in healthcare utilization. In the majority of studies between two and four types of implementation challenges were found.<b>Conclusions and recommendations:</b> The TELEMED database provides an easily accessible overview of existing evidence-based telemedicine services for use by hospital managers and health professionals, who whish to to implement telemedicine.

KEA3 can be applied to analyze data from phosphoproteomics and proteomics studies to predict the upstream kinases responsible for observed differential phosphorylations. The KEA3 background database contains measured and predicted kinase-substrate interactions (KSI), kinase-protein interactions (KPI), and interactions supported by co-expression and co-occurrence data. To benchmark the performance of KEA3, we examined whether KEA3 can predict the perturbed kinase from single-kinase perturbation followed by gene expression experiments, and phosphoproteomics data collected from kinase-targeting small molecules.

"34224351","Deep Learning for Ultrasound Image Formation: CUBDL Evaluation Framework &amp; Open Datasets.","Deep learning for ultrasound image formation is rapidly garnering research support and attention, quickly rising as the latest frontier in ultrasound image formation, with much promise to balance both image quality and display speed. Despite this promise, one challenge with identifying optimal solutions is the absence of unified evaluation methods and datasets that are not specific to a single research group. This paper introduces the largest known international database of ultrasound channel data and describes associated evaluation methods that were initially developed for the Challenge on Ultrasound Beamforming with Deep Learning (CUBDL), which was offered as a component of the 2020 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium. We summarize the challenge results and present qualitative and quantitative assessments using both the initially closed CUBDL evaluation test dataset (which was crowd-sourced from multiple groups around the world) and additional in vivo breast ultrasound data contributed after the challenge was completed. As an example quantitative assessment, single plane wave images from the CUBDL Task 1 dataset produced a mean generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR) of 0.67 and a mean lateral resolution of 0.42 mm when formed with delay-and-sum beamforming, compared to a mean gCNR as high as 0.81 and a mean lateral resolution as low as 0.32 mm when formed with networks submitted by the challenge winners.

"33863373","IrGO: Iranian traditional medicine General Ontology and knowledge base.","<h4>Background</h4>Iranian traditional medicine, also known as Persian Medicine, is a holistic school of medicine with a long prolific history. It describes numerous concepts and the relationships between them. However, no unified language system has been proposed for the concepts of this medicine up to the present time. Considering the extensive terminology in the numerous textbooks written by the scholars over centuries, comprehending the totality of concepts is obviously a very challenging task. To resolve this issue, overcome the obstacles, and code the concepts in a reusable manner, constructing an ontology of the concepts of Iranian traditional medicine seems a necessity.<h4>Construction and content</h4>Makhzan al-Advieh, an encyclopedia of materia medica compiled by Mohammad Hossein Aghili Khorasani, was selected as the resource to create an ontology of the concepts used to describe medicinal substances. The steps followed to accomplish this task included (1) compiling the list of classes via examination of textbooks, and text mining the resource followed by manual review to ensure comprehensiveness of extracted terms; (2) arranging the classes in a taxonomy; (3) determining object and data properties; (4) specifying annotation properties including ID, labels (English and Persian), alternative terms, and definitions (English and Persian); (5) ontology evaluation. The ontology was created using Prot√©g√© with adherence to the principles of ontology development provided by the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) foundry.<h4>Utility and discussion</h4>The ontology was finalized with inclusion of 3521 classes, 15 properties, and 20,903 axioms in the Iranian traditional medicine General Ontology (IrGO) database, freely available at http://ir-go.net/ . An indented list and an interactive graph view using WebVOWL were used to visualize the ontology. All classes were linked to their instances in UNaProd database to create a knowledge base of ITM materia medica.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We constructed an ontology-based knowledge base of ITM concepts in the domain of materia medica to help offer a shared and common understanding of this concept, enable reuse of the knowledge, and make the assumptions explicit. This ontology will aid Persian medicine practitioners in clinical decision-making to select drugs. Extending IrGO will bridge the gap between traditional and conventional schools of medicine, helping guide future research in the process of drug discovery.","http://ir-go.net/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""ir"", ""go"", ""net"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""irgo"", ""iranian"", ""traditional"", ""medicine"", ""ral"", ""ontology"", """", ""knowledge"", ""base"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>iranian"", ""traditional"", ""medicine"", """", ""known"", ""as"", ""persian"", ""is"", ""a"", ""holistic"", ""school"", ""of"", """", ""long"", ""prolific"", ""history"", ""it"", ""describes"", ""numerous"", ""concepts"", """", """", ""relationships"", ""between"", ""m"", ""however"", ""no"", ""unified"", ""language"", ""system"", """", """", ""proposed"", """", """", ""up"", ""to"", ""present"", """", ""considering"", ""extensive"", ""terminology"", ""in"", ""textbooks"", ""written"", ""by"", ""scholars"", """", ""centuries"",

Here, we describe a data resource, the Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK; https://darkkinome.org), that is specifically focused on providing data and reagents for these understudied kinases to the broader research community. Supported through NIH's Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) Program, the DKK is focused on data and knowledge generation for 162 poorly studied or 'dark' kinases. Types of data provided through the DKK include parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) peptides for quantitative proteomics, protein interactions, NanoBRET reagents, and kinase-specific compounds. Higher-level data is similarly being generated and consolidated such as tissue gene expression profiles and, longer-term, functional relationships derived through perturbation studies. Associated web tools that help investigators interrogate both internal and external data are also provided through the site.

"33175872","High density genotype storage for plant breeding in the Chado schema of Breedbase.","Modern breeding programs routinely use genome-wide information for selecting individuals to advance. The large volumes of genotypic information required present a challenge for data storage and query efficiency. Major use cases require genotyping data to be linked with trait phenotyping data. In contrast to phenotyping data that are often stored in relational database schemas, next-generation genotyping data are traditionally stored in non-relational storage systems due to their extremely large scope. This study presents a novel data model implemented in Breedbase (https://breedbase.org/) for uniting relational phenotyping data and non-relational genotyping data within the open-source PostgreSQL database engine. Breedbase is an open-source, web-database designed to manage all of a breeder's informatics needs: management of field experiments, phenotypic and genotypic data collection and storage, and statistical analyses. The genotyping data is stored in a PostgreSQL data-type known as binary JavaScript Object Notation (JSONb), where the JSON structures closely follow the Variant Call Format (VCF) data model. The Breedbase genotyping data model can handle different ploidy levels, structural variants, and any genotype encoded in VCF. JSONb is both compressed and indexed, resulting in a space and time efficient system. Furthermore, file caching maximizes data retrieval performance. Integration of all breeding data within the Chado database schema retains referential integrity that may be lost when genotyping and phenotyping data are stored in separate systems. Benchmarking demonstrates that the system is fast enough for computation of a genomic relationship matrix (GRM) and genome wide association study (GWAS) for datasets involving 1,325 diploid Zea mays, 314 triploid Musa acuminata, and 924 diploid Manihot esculenta samples genotyped with 955,690, 142,119, and 287,952 genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) markers, respectively.","https://breedbase.org/)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""breedbase"", """")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""density"", ""geype"", ""storage"", """", ""plant"", ""breeding"", ""in"", """", ""chado"", ""schema"", ""of"", ""breedbase"")","c(""modern"", ""breeding"", ""programs"", ""routinely"", """", ""genome"", ""wide"", ""inmation"", """", ""selecting"", ""individuals"", ""to"", ""advance"", """", ""large"", ""volumes"", ""of"", ""geypic"", ""required"", ""present"", ""a"", ""chenge"", """", ""storage"", """", ""query"", ""efficiency"", ""major"", ""cases"", ""require"", ""geyping"", ""be"", ""linked"", """", ""trait"", ""pheyping"", ""in"", ""contrast"", """", """", ""often"", ""stored"", ""relational"", ""base"", ""schemas"", ""next"", ""ration"", ""traditiony"", ""non"",

"32614400","iPromoter-BnCNN: a novel branched CNN-based predictor for identifying and classifying sigma promoters.","<h4>Motivation</h4>Promoter is a short region of DNA which is responsible for initiating transcription of specific genes. Development of computational tools for automatic identification of promoters is in high demand. According to the difference of functions, promoters can be of different types. Promoters may have both intra- and interclass variation and similarity in terms of consensus sequences. Accurate classification of various types of sigma promoters still remains a challenge.<h4>Results</h4>We present iPromoter-BnCNN for identification and accurate classification of six types of promoters-œÉ24,œÉ28,œÉ32,œÉ38,œÉ54,œÉ70. It is a CNN-based classifier which combines local features related to monomer nucleotide sequence, trimer nucleotide sequence, dimer structural properties and trimer structural properties through the use of parallel branching. We conducted experiments on a benchmark dataset and compared with six state-of-the-art tools to show our supremacy on 5-fold cross-validation. Moreover, we tested our classifier on an independent test dataset.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Our proposed tool iPromoter-BnCNN web server is freely available at http://103.109.52.8/iPromoter-BnCNN.

Blood-based screenings using circulating DNAs (ctDNAs), circulating RNA (ctRNAs), circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs) have shown promising prospects in the early detection of cancer. Recent high-throughput gene expression profiling of blood samples from cancer patients has provided a valuable resource for developing new biomarkers for the early detection of cancer. However, a well-organized online repository for these blood-based high-throughput gene expression data is still not available.

As the most species-rich group of sexually reproducing organisms on Earth, insects have multiple sex determination systems. Though sex chromosomes and sex-biased genes are well-studied in dozens of insects, their gene sequences are scattered in various databases. Moreover, a shortage of annotation hinders the deep mining of these data. Here, we collected the chromosome-level sex chromosome data of 49 insect species, including 34 X chromosomes, 15 Z chromosomes, 5 W chromosomes and 2 Y chromosomes. We also obtained Y-linked contigs of four insects species-Anopheles gambiae, Drosophila innubila, Drosophila yakuba and Tribolium castaneum. The unannotated chromosome-level sex chromosomes were annotated using a standard pipeline, yielding a total of 123‚Äâ030 protein-coding genes, 2‚Äâ159‚Äâ427 repeat sequences, 894 miRNAs, 1574 rRNAs, 5105 tRNAs, 395 snoRNAs (small nucleolar RNA), 54 snRNAs (small nuclear RNA) and 5959 other ncRNAs (non-coding RNA). In addition, 36‚Äâ781 sex-biased genes were identified by analyzing 62 RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) datasets. Together with 5707 sex-biased genes from the Drosophila genus collected from the Sex-Associated Gene Database, we obtained a total of 42‚Äâ488 sex-biased genes from 13 insect species.

However, except for cancer-related variants, there is no collection of postzygotic mosaic variants in noncancer disease-related and healthy individuals. Here, we present MosaicBase, a comprehensive database that includes 6698 mosaic variants related to 266 noncancer diseases and 27,991 mosaic variants identified in 422 healthy individuals. Genomic and phenotypic information of each variant was manually extracted and curated from 383 publications. MosaicBase supports the query of variants with Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) entries, genomic coordinates, gene symbols, or Entrez IDs. We also provide an integrated genome browser for users to easily access mosaic variants and their related annotations for any genomic region. By analyzing the variants collected in MosaicBase, we find that mosaic variants that directly contribute to disease phenotype show features distinct from those of variants in individuals with mild or no phenotypes, in terms of their genomic distribution, mutation signatures, and fraction of mutant cells. MosaicBase will not only assist clinicians in genetic counseling and diagnosis but also provide a useful resource to understand the genomic baseline of postzygotic mutations in the general human population.

"33461215","Ligand-based approach for predicting drug targets and for virtual screening against COVID-19.","Discovering efficient drugs and identifying target proteins are still an unmet but urgent need for curing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Protein structure-based docking is a widely applied approach for discovering active compounds against drug targets and for predicting potential targets of active compounds. However, this approach has its inherent deficiency caused by e.g. various different conformations with largely varied binding pockets adopted by proteins, or the lack of true target proteins in the database. This deficiency may result in false negative results. As a complementary approach to the protein structure-based platform for COVID-19, termed as D3Docking in our previous work, we developed in this study a ligand-based method, named D3Similarity, which is based on the molecular similarity evaluation between the submitted molecule(s) and those in an active compound database. The database is constituted by all the reported bioactive molecules against the coronaviruses, viz., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 (HCoV-EMC), human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), some of which have target or mechanism information but some do not. Based on the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) similarity evaluation of molecular structures, virtual screening and target prediction could be performed according to similarity ranking results. With two examples, we demonstrated the reliability and efficiency of D3Similarity by using 2D‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ3D value as score for drug discovery and target prediction against COVID-19.

"33858332","Predicting tumor response to drugs based on gene-expression biomarkers of sensitivity learned from cancer cell lines.","<h4>Background</h4>Human cancer cell line profiling and drug sensitivity studies provide valuable information about the therapeutic potential of drugs and their possible mechanisms of action. The goal of those studies is to translate the findings from in vitro studies of cancer cell lines into in vivo therapeutic relevance and, eventually, patients' care. Tremendous progress has been made.<h4>Results</h4>In this work, we built predictive models for 453 drugs using data on gene expression and drug sensitivity (IC<sub>50</sub>) from cancer cell lines. We identified many known drug-gene interactions and uncovered several potentially novel drug-gene associations. Importantly, we further applied these predictive models to ~‚Äâ17,000 bulk RNA-seq samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database to predict drug sensitivity for both normal and tumor tissues. We created a web site for users to visualize and download our predicted data ( https://manticore.niehs.nih.gov/cancerRxTissue ). Using trametinib as an example, we showed that our approach can faithfully recapitulate the known tumor specificity of the drug.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We demonstrated that our approach can predict drugs that 1) are tumor-type specific; 2) elicit higher sensitivity from tumor compared to corresponding normal tissue; 3) elicit differential sensitivity across breast cancer subtypes. If validated, our prediction could have relevance for preclinical drug testing and in phase I clinical design.","https://manticore.niehs.nih.gov/cancerRxTissue",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""manticore"", ""niehs"", ""nih"", ""gov"", ""cerrxtissue"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""predicting"", ""tumor"", ""response"", ""to"", ""s"", ""based"", ""on"", """", ""expression"", ""biomarkers"", ""of"", ""sensitivity"", ""learned"", """", ""cer"", """", ""lines"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>human"", ""cer"", """", ""line"", ""profiling"", """", """", ""sensitivity"", ""studies"", ""provide"", ""valuable"", ""inmation"", ""about"", """", ""rapeutic"", ""potential"", ""of"", ""s"", ""ir"", ""possible"", ""mechanisms"", ""action"", ""goal"", ""those"", ""is"", ""to"", ""translate"", ""findings"", """", ""in"", ""vitro"", ""lines"", """", ""vivo"", ""relevance"", ""eventuy"", ""patients"", ""c"", ""tremendous"", ""progress"", """", """", ""made"", ""<h4>results<"", ""h4>in"", """", ""work"", ""we"", ""built"",

"32943659","The landscape of microsatellites in the enset (Ensete ventricosum) genome and web-based marker resource development.","Ensete ventricosum (Musaceae, enset) is an Ethiopian food security crop. To realize the potential of enset for rural livelihoods, further knowledge of enset diversity, genetics and genomics is required to support breeding programs and conservation. This study was conducted to explore the enset genome to develop molecular markers, genomics resources, and characterize enset landraces while giving insight into the organization of the genome. We identified 233 microsatellites (simple sequence repeats, SSRs) per Mbp in the enset genome, representing 0.28% of the genome. Mono- and di-nucleotide repeats motifs were found in a higher proportion than other classes of SSR-motifs. In total, 154,586 non-redundant enset microsatellite markers (EMM) were identified and 40 selected for primer development. Marker validation by PCR and low-cost agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that 92.5% were polymorphic, showing a high PIC (Polymorphism Information Content; 0.87) and expected heterozygosity (He‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.79-0.82). In silico analysis of genomes of closely related species showed 46.86% of the markers were transferable among enset species and 1.90% were transferable to Musa. The SSRs are robust (with basic PCR methods and agarose gel electrophoresis), informative, and applicable in measuring enset diversity, genotyping, selection and potentially breeding.

"33995920","<i>ExVe</i>: The knowledge base of orthologous proteins identified in fungal extracellular vesicles.","Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are double-membrane particles associated with intercellular communication. Since the discovery of EV production in the fungus <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>, the importance of EV release in its physiology and pathogenicity has been investigated. To date, few studies have investigated the proteomic content of EVs from multiple fungal species. Our main objective was to use an orthology approach to compare proteins identified by EV shotgun proteomics in 8 pathogenic and 1 nonpathogenic species. Using protein information from the UniProt and FungiDB databases, we integrated data for 11,433 hits in fungal EVs with an orthology perspective, resulting in 3,834 different orthologous groups. OG6_100083 (Hsp70 Pfam domain) was the unique orthologous group that was identified for all fungal species. Proteins with this protein domain are associated with the stress response, survival and morphological changes in different fungal species. Although no pathogenic orthologous group was found, we identified 5 orthologous groups exclusive to <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Using the criteria of at least 7 pathogenic fungi to define a cluster, we detected the 4 unique pathogenic orthologous groups. Taken together, our data suggest that Hsp70-related proteins might play a key role in fungal EVs, regardless of the pathogenic status. Using an orthology approach, we identified at least 4 protein domains that could be novel therapeutic targets against pathogenic fungi.

"33876217","CanDriS: posterior profiling of cancer-driving sites based on two-component evolutionary model.","Current cancer genomics databases have accumulated millions of somatic mutations that remain to be further explored. Due to the over-excess mutations unrelated to cancer, the great challenge is to identify somatic mutations that are cancer-driven. Under the notion that carcinogenesis is a form of somatic-cell evolution, we developed a two-component mixture model: while the ground component corresponds to passenger mutations, the rapidly evolving component corresponds to driver mutations. Then, we implemented an empirical Bayesian procedure to calculate the posterior probability of a site being cancer-driven. Based on these, we developed a software CanDriS (Cancer Driver Sites) to profile the potential cancer-driving sites for thousands of tumor samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas and International Cancer Genome Consortium across tumor types and pan-cancer level. As a result, we identified that approximately 1% of the sites have posterior probabilities larger than 0.90 and listed potential cancer-wide and cancer-specific driver mutations. By comprehensively profiling all potential cancer-driving sites, CanDriS greatly enhances our ability to refine our knowledge of the genetic basis of cancer and might guide clinical medication in the upcoming era of precision medicine.

Meadow fescue has very high quality of yield with good winter survival and persistency. However, extensive genomic resources for meadow fescue have not become available so far. To address this lack of comprehensive publicly available datasets, we have developed functionally annotated draft genome sequences of two meadow fescue genotypes, 'HF7/2' and 'B14/16', and constructed the platform ForageGrassBase, available at http://foragegrass.org/, for data visualization, download and querying. This is the first open-access platform that provides extensive genomic resources related to this forage grass species. The current database provides the most up-to-date draft genome sequence along with structural and functional annotations for genes that can be accessed using Genome Browser (GBrowse), along with comparative genomic alignments to Arabidopsis, L. perenne, barley, rice, Brachypodium and maize genomes. We have integrated homologous search tool BLAST also for the users to analyze their data. Combined, GBrowse, BLAST and downloadable data gives a user-friendly access to meadow fescue genomic resources.

"32738156","Predicted yeast interactome and network-based interpretation of transcriptionally changed genes.","Saccharomyces cerevisiae, budding yeast, is a widely used model organism and research tool in genetics studies. Many efforts have been directed at constructing a high-quality comprehensive molecular interaction network to elucidate the design logic of the gene circuitries in this classic model organism. In this work, we present the yeast interactome resource (YIR), which includes 22,238 putative functional gene interactions inferred from functional gene association data integrated from 10 databases focusing on diverse functional perspectives. These putative functional gene interactions are expected to cover 18.84% of yeast protein interactions, and 38.49% may represent protein interactions. Based on the YIR, a gene set linkage analysis (GSLA) web tool was developed to annotate the potential functional impacts of a set of transcriptionally changed genes. In a case study, we show that the YIR/GSLA system produced more extensive and concise annotations compared with widely used gene set annotation tools, including PANTHER and DAVID.

"32117995","Nc2Eye: A Curated ncRNAomics Knowledgebase for Bridging Basic and Clinical Research in Eye Diseases.","Eye diseases (EDs) represent a group of disorders affecting the visual system, most of which can lead to visual impairment and blindness. Accumulating evidence reveals that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are closely associated with a wide variety of EDs. However, abundant associations between ncRNAs and EDs are scattered across the published literature, obstructing a global view of ncRNA-ED associations. A public resource of high-quality manually curated ncRNAomics knowledge associated with EDs remains unavailable. To address this gap, we thus developed Nc2Eye (http://nc2eye.bio-data.cn/), which is the first knowledgebase dedicated to providing a comprehensive ncRNAomics resource for bridging basic and clinical research in EDs. Through a comprehensive review of more than 2400 published papers, Nc2Eye catalogs 7088 manually curated ncRNA-ED associations involving 4363 ncRNAs across eight species. We also provide detailed descriptions and annotation information for each ncRNA-disease association such as ncRNA categories, experimental methods, expression pattern and related clinical drugs. To further expand the pathogenic ncRNAs, we also collected more than 90 high-throughput EDs-related transcriptome datasets. Furthermore, a user-friendly interface was constructed for convenient and flexible data browsing, querying, and retrieving.

"33858848","HLA Ligand Atlas: a benign reference of HLA-presented peptides to improve T-cell-based cancer immunotherapy.","<h4>Background</h4>The human leucocyte antigen (HLA) complex controls adaptive immunity by presenting defined fractions of the intracellular and extracellular protein content to immune cells. Understanding the benign HLA ligand repertoire is a prerequisite to define safe T-cell-based immunotherapies against cancer. Due to the poor availability of benign tissues, if available, normal tissue adjacent to the tumor has been used as a benign surrogate when defining tumor-associated antigens. However, this comparison has proven to be insufficient and even resulted in lethal outcomes. In order to match the tumor immunopeptidome with an equivalent counterpart, we created the HLA Ligand Atlas, the first extensive collection of paired HLA-I and HLA-II immunopeptidomes from 227 benign human tissue samples. This dataset facilitates a balanced comparison between tumor and benign tissues on HLA ligand level.<h4>Methods</h4>Human tissue samples were obtained from 16 subjects at autopsy, five thymus samples and two ovary samples originating from living donors. HLA ligands were isolated via immunoaffinity purification and analyzed in over 1200 liquid chromatography mass spectrometry runs. Experimentally and computationally reproducible protocols were employed for data acquisition and processing.<h4>Results</h4>The initial release covers 51 HLA-I and 86 HLA-II allotypes presenting 90,428 HLA-I- and 142,625 HLA-II ligands. The HLA allotypes are representative for the world population. We observe that immunopeptidomes differ considerably between tissues and individuals on source protein and HLA-ligand level. Moreover, we discover 1407 HLA-I ligands from non-canonical genomic regions. Such peptides were previously described in tumors, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), healthy lung tissues and cell lines. In a case study in glioblastoma, we show that potential on-target off-tumor adverse events in immunotherapy can be avoided by comparing tumor immunopeptidomes to the provided multi-tissue reference.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Given that T-cell-based immunotherapies, such as CAR-T cells, affinity-enhanced T cell transfer, cancer vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibition, have significant side effects, the HLA Ligand Atlas is the first step toward defining tumor-associated targets with an improved safety profile.

"33391542","Network- and systems-based re-engineering of dendritic cells with non-coding RNAs for cancer immunotherapy.","Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells that induce and regulate adaptive immunity by presenting antigens to T cells. Due to their coordinative role in adaptive immune responses, DCs have been used as cell-based therapeutic vaccination against cancer. The capacity of DCs to induce a therapeutic immune response can be enhanced by re-wiring of cellular signalling pathways with microRNAs (miRNAs). <b>Methods:</b> Since the activation and maturation of DCs is controlled by an interconnected signalling network, we deploy an approach that combines RNA sequencing data and systems biology methods to delineate miRNA-based strategies that enhance DC-elicited immune responses. <b>Results:</b> Through RNA sequencing of IKKŒ≤-matured DCs that are currently being tested in a clinical trial on therapeutic anti-cancer vaccination, we identified 44 differentially expressed miRNAs. According to a network analysis, most of these miRNAs regulate targets that are linked to immune pathways, such as cytokine and interleukin signalling. We employed a network topology-oriented scoring model to rank the miRNAs, analysed their impact on immunogenic potency of DCs, and identified dozens of promising miRNA candidates, with miR-15a and miR-16 as the top ones. The results of our analysis are presented in a database that constitutes a tool to identify DC-relevant miRNA-gene interactions with therapeutic potential (https://www.synmirapy.net/dc-optimization). <b>Conclusions:</b> Our approach enables the systematic analysis and identification of functional miRNA-gene interactions that can be experimentally tested for improving DC immunogenic potency.","https://www.synmirapy.net/dc-optimization).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", """", ""synmirapy"", ""net"", ""dc"", ""optimization"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""nerk"", """", ""systems"", ""based"", ""re"", ""engineering"", ""of"", ""dendritic"", ""s"", """", ""non"", ""coding"", ""s"", """", ""cer"", ""immuherapy"")","c(""dendritic"", ""s"", ""dcs"", """", ""professional"", ""antigen"", ""presenting"", """", ""induce"", """", ""regulate"", ""adaptive"", ""immunity"", ""by"", ""antigens"", ""to"", ""t"", ""due"", ""ir"", ""coordinative"", ""role"", ""in"", ""immune"", ""responses"", """", """", """", ""as"", """", ""based"", ""rapeutic"", ""vaccination"", ""against"", ""cer"", """", ""capacity"", ""of"", ""a"", ""response"", """", ""be"", ""enhanced"", ""re"", ""wiring"", ""ular"", ""signing"", ""pathways"", """", ""micros"", ""mis"", ""<b>methods"",

"34174821","Construction of a high-density linkage map and graphical representation of the arrangement of transcriptome-based unigene markers on the chromosomes of onion, Allium cepa L.","<h4>Background</h4>Genomic information for Allium cepa L. is limited as it is heterozygous and its genome is very large. To elucidate potential SNP markers obtained by NGS, we used a complete set of A. fistulosum L.-A. cepa monosomic addition lines (MALs) and doubled haploids (DHs). These were the parental lines of an A. cepa mapping population for transcriptome-based SNP genotyping.<h4>Results</h4>We mapped the transcriptome sequence reads from a series of A. fistulosum-A. cepa MALs onto the unigene sequence of the doubled haploid shallot A. cepa Aggregatum group (DHA) and compared the MAL genotype call for parental bunching onion and shallot transcriptome mapping data. We identified SNP sites with at least four reads on 25,462 unigenes. They were anchored on eight A. cepa chromosomes. A single SNP site was identified on 3,278 unigenes and multiple SNPs were identified on 22,184 unigenes. The chromosome marker information was made public via the web database Allium TDB ( http://alliumtdb.kazusa.or.jp/ ). To apply transcriptome based genotyping approach for genetic mapping, we gathered RNA sequence data from 96 lines of a DHA √ó doubled haploid bulb onion A. cepa common onion group (DHC) mapping population. After selecting co-dominant SNP sites, 16,872 SNPs were identified in 5,339 unigenes. Of these, at least two SNPs with identical genotypes were found in 1,435 unigenes. We developed a linkage map using genotype information from these unigenes. All unigene markers mapped onto the eight chromosomes and graphical genotyping was conducted based on the unigene order information. Another 2,963 unigenes were allocated onto the eight chromosomes. To confirm the accuracy of this transcriptome-based genetic linkage map, conventional PCR-based markers were used for linkage analysis. All SNP - and PCR-based markers were mapped onto the expected linkage groups and no inconsistency was found among these chromosomal locations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Effective transcriptome analysis with unique Allium resources successfully associated numerous chromosome markers with unigene information and a high-density A. cepa linkage map.

"32592631","A study on the structure, mechanism, and biochemistry of kanamycin B dioxygenase (KanJ)-an enzyme with a broad range of substrates.","Kanamycin A is an aminoglycoside antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces kanamyceticus and used against a wide spectrum of bacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Biosynthesis of kanamycin involves an oxidative deamination step catalyzed by kanamycin B dioxygenase (KanJ), thereby the C2' position of kanamycin B is transformed into a keto group upon release of ammonia. Here, we present for the first time, structural models of KanJ with several ligands, which along with the results of ITC binding assays and HPLC activity tests explain substrate specificity of the enzyme. The large size of the binding pocket suggests that KanJ can accept a broad range of substrates, which was confirmed by activity tests. Specificity of the enzyme with respect to its substrate is determined by the hydrogen bond interactions between the methylamino group of the antibiotic and highly conserved Asp134 and Cys150 as well as between hydroxyl groups of the substrate and Asn120 and Gln80. Upon antibiotic binding, the C terminus loop is significantly rearranged and Gln80 and Asn120, which are directly involved in substrate recognition, change their conformations. Based on reaction energy profiles obtained by density functional theory (DFT) simulations, we propose a mechanism of ketone formation involving the reactive Fe<sup>IV</sup>  = O and proceeding either via OH rebound, which yields a hemiaminal intermediate or by abstraction of two hydrogen atoms, which leads to an imine species. At acidic pH, the latter involves a lower barrier than the OH rebound, whereas at basic pH, the barrier leading to an imine vanishes completely.

"32270255","Major depressive disorder and cardiometabolic diseases: a bidirectional Mendelian randomisation study.","AIMS/HYPOTHESIS:Observational studies have shown a bidirectional association between major depressive disorder (MDD) and cardiometabolic diseases. We conducted a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomisation (MR) study to assess the causal associations of MDD with type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure and vice versa. METHODS:We extracted summary-level data for MDD, type 2 diabetes, CAD and heart failure from corresponding published large genome-wide association studies of individuals mainly of European-descent. In total, 96 SNPs for MDD, 202 SNPs for type 2 diabetes, 44 SNPs for CAD and 12 SNPs for heart failure were proposed as instrumental variables at the genome-wide significance level (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ5‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10-8). The random-effects inverse-variance weighted method was used for the main analyses. RESULTS:Genetic liability to MDD was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes and CAD at the Bonferroni-corrected significance level. The ORs of type 2 diabetes and CAD were respectively 1.26 (95% CI 1.10, 1.43; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ6‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10-4) and 1.16 (95% CI 1.05, 1.29; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.0047) per one-unit increase in loge odds of MDD. There was a suggestive association between MDD and heart failure (OR 1.11 [95% CI 1.01, 1.21]; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.033). We found limited evidence supporting causal effects of cardiometabolic diseases on MDD risk in the reverse MR analyses. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION:The present study strengthened the evidence that MDD is a potential risk factor for type 2 diabetes and CAD. Whether MDD is causally related to heart failure needs further study.

"31220119","Interlaboratory study to validate a STR profiling method for intraspecies identification of mouse cell lines.","The Consortium for Mouse Cell Line Authentication was formed to validate Short Tandem Repeat (STR) markers for intraspecies identification of mouse cell lines. The STR profiling method is a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay comprised of primers targeting 19 mouse STR markers and two human STR markers (for interspecies contamination screening). The goals of the Consortium were to perform an interlaboratory study to-(1) validate the mouse STR markers to uniquely identify mouse cell lines (intraspecies identification), (2) to provide a public database of mouse cell lines with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-validated mouse STR profiles, and (3) to publish the results of the interlaboratory study. The interlaboratory study was an international effort that consisted of 12 participating laboratories representing institutions from academia, industry, biological resource centers, and government. The study was based on 50 of the most commonly used mouse cell lines obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Of the 50 mouse cell lines, 18 had unique STR profiles that were 100% concordant (match) among all Consortium laboratory members, and the remaining 32 cell lines had discordance that was resolved readily and led to improvement of the assay. The discordance was due to low signal and interpretation issues involving artifacts and genotyping errors. Although the total number of discordant STR profiles was relatively high in this study, the percent of labs agreeing on allele calls among the discordant samples was above 92%. The STR profiles, including electropherogram images, for NIST-validated mouse cell lines will be published on the NCBI BioSample Database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/). Overall, the interlaboratory study showed that the multiplex PCR method using 18 of the 19 mouse STR markers is capable of discriminating at the intraspecies level between mouse cell lines. Further studies are ongoing to refine the assay including (1) development of an allelic ladder for improving the accuracy of allele calling and (2) integration of stutter filters to identify true stutter.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", """", ""ncbi"", ""nlm"", ""nih"", ""gov"", ""biosample"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""interlaboratory"", ""study"", ""to"", ""validate"", ""a"", ""str"", ""profiling"", ""method"", """", ""intraspecies"", ""identification"", ""of"", ""mo"", """", ""lines"")","c("""", ""consortium"", """", ""mo"", """", ""line"", ""auntication"", """", ""med"", ""to"", ""validate"", ""short"", ""tem"", ""repeat"", ""str"", ""markers"", ""intraspecies"", ""identification"", ""of"", ""lines"", ""profiling"", ""method"", ""is"", ""a"", ""multiplex"", ""polymerase"", ""chain"", ""reaction"", ""pcr"", ""assay"", ""prised"", ""primers"", ""targeting"", ""19"", """", """", ""human"", ""interspecies"", ""contamination"", ""screening"", ""goals"", """", ""perm"", ""an"", ""interlaboratory"", ""study"", ""1"", ""uniquely"", ""identify"",

Of all the parameters evaluated, our results demonstrated no statistically significant relation between preoperative DJ stenting and the presence of RFs (œá2 (1)‚Äâ=‚Äâ158.418; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.099). RFs were significantly higher in patients treated with UAS (82 patients, 29.3%) during the procedure compared to the cases who did not receive UAS (194 patients, 23.3%) (œá2 (1)‚Äâ=‚Äâ3.999; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.046). The mean period for a secondary intervention after RIRS was 28.39 (¬±‚Äâ12.52) days. Regarding the procedures applied for RF removal, re-RIRS was the most commonly performed approach (56%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Despite the reported safe and successful outcomes, the incidence of RFs is higher, after the RIRS procedure particularly in cases with relatively larger calculi. Such cases need to be followed in a close manner and although a second flexible ureteroscopy is the treatment of choice for fragment removal in the majority of these patients, shock wave lithotripsy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy may also be preferred in selected cases.","https://acup.uroturk.org.tr/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", ""acup"", ""uroturk"", """", ""tr"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""retrograde"", ""intrnal"", ""surgery"", ""of"", ""renal"", ""sts"", ""a"", ""critical"", ""multi"", ""aspect"", ""evaluation"", """", ""outes"", ""by"", ""turkish"", ""academy"", ""urology"", ""prospective"", ""study"", ""group"", ""acup"")","c(""<h4>aims<"", ""h4>to"", ""outline"", """", ""evaluate"", """", ""incidence"", ""management"", ""follow"", ""up"", ""of"", ""residual"", ""fragments"", ""rfs"", ""following"", ""retrograde"", ""intrnal"", ""surgery"", ""rirs"", ""renal"", ""sts"", ""by"", ""turkish"", ""academy"", ""urology"", ""prospective"", ""study"", ""group"", ""acup"", ""<h4>methods<"", ""h4>following"", ""ethical"", ""mittee"", ""approval"", ""15"", ""centers"", ""providing"", """", ""regarding"", ""after"", """", ""included"", """", ""relevant"", ""inmation"", """", ""recorded"",

"33970805","Medicinal plant compounds as promising inhibitors of coronavirus (COVID-19) main protease: an <i>in silico</i> study.","The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the globe and has involved more than 215 countries and territories. Due to a lack of effective therapy or vaccine, urgent and concerted efforts are needed to identify therapeutic targets and medications. COVID-19 main protease represents a major target for drug treatment to inhibit viral function. The present study sought to evaluate medicinal plant compounds as potential inhibitors of the COVID-19 main protease using molecular docking and molecular dynamic analysis. The PDB files of COVID-19 main protease and some medicinal plant compounds were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org) and Pubchem server, respectively. The Gromacs software was used for simulation studies, and molecular docking analysis was done using Autodock 4.2. The COVID-19 main protease simulation, compared with some phytochemicals docked to the COVID-19 main protease, were analyzed. Glabridin, catechin, and fisetin had the greatest tendency to interact with the COVID-19 main protease by hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions. Docking of these phytochemicals to COVID-19 main protease led to an increase in the radius of gyration (Rg), decrease in the Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and induced variation in COVID-19 main protease secondary structure. The high tendency interaction of glabridin, catechin, and fisetin to COVID-19 main protease induced conformational changes on this enzyme. These interactions can lead to enzyme inhibition. This simulated study indicates that these phytochemicals may be considered as potent inhibitors of the viral protease; however, more investigations are required to explore their potential medicinal use.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The MS Resource Pillar of the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) Human Proteome Project (HPP) initiated the Phosphopeptide Challenge as a resource to help the community evaluate methods, learn procedures and data analysis routines, and establish their own workflows by comparing results obtained from a standard set of 94 phosphopeptides (serine, threonine, tyrosine) and their nonphosphorylated counterparts mixed at different ratios in a neat sample and a yeast background. Participants analyzed both samples with their method(s) of choice to report the identification and site localization of these peptides, determine their relative abundances, and enrich for the phosphorylated peptides in the yeast background. We discuss the results from 22 laboratories that used a range of different methods, instruments, and analysis software. We reanalyzed submitted data with a single software pipeline and highlight the successes and challenges in correct phosphosite localization.

"33890543","The latest development of the DELAD project for sharing corpora of speech disorders.","Corpora of speech of individuals with communication disorders (CSD) are invaluable resources for education and research, but they are costly and hard to build and difficult to share for various reasons. DELAD, which means 'shared' in Swedish, is a project initiated by Professors Nicole M√ºller and Martin Ball in 2015 that aims to address this issue by establishing a platform for researchers to share datasets of speech disorders with interested audiences. To date four workshops have been held, where selected participants, covering various expertise including researchers in clinical phonetics and linguistics, speech and language therapy, infrastructure specialists, and ethics and legal specialists, participated to discuss relevant issues in setting up such an archive. Positive and steady progress has been made since 2015, including refurbishing the DELAD website (http://delad.net/) with information and application forms for researchers to join and share their datasets and linking with the CLARIN K-Centre for Atypical Communication Expertise (https://ace.ruhosting.nl/) where CSD can be hosted and accessed through the CLARIN B-Centres, The Language Archive (https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/) and TalkBank (https://talkbank.org/). The latest workshop, which was funded by CLARIN (Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure) was held as an online event in January 2021 on topics including Data Protection Impact Assessments, reviewing changes in ethics perspectives in academia on sharing CSD, and voice conversion as a mean to pseudonomise speech.

"33342295","Markedness and implicational relationships in phonological development: A cross-linguistic investigation.","<h4>Purpose</h4>The complexity approach to speech disorders, based on the theoretical notion of phonological markedness, has been gaining interest over the last decade. In a nutshell, this approach suggests that the acquisition of phonologically marked units (e.g. complex onsets) implies the acquisition of less marked ones (e.g. singleton onsets). However, because the notion of markedness is, itself, subject to controversies, we need to constrain what types of implications can be generalised among language learners, within and across languages.<h4>Method</h4>We report on longitudinal data from one phonologically-disordered and five typically-developing children documented across four different languages (English, French, German, Portuguese), using data from the PhonBank database (https://phonbank.talkbank.org). Using the Phon software program (https://www.phon.ca), we systematically analysed each longitudinal study for consonants in singleton onsets and codas as well as in onset clusters.<h4>Result</h4>The implicational relationships supported by our study involve units of similar types (e.g. relations between different segmental categories), while relationships that involve different types of units or processes cannot be generalised across learners.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A better understanding of implicational relationships makes the complexity approach more predictive of developmental patterns of phonology and related phonological disorders.","c(""https://phonbank.talkbank.org).""","""https://www.phon.ca)",""")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""c"", """", ""phonbank"", ""talkbank"", """")","c("""", """", """", ""phon"", ""ca"")","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""markedness"", """", ""implicational"", ""relationships"", ""in"", ""phonological"", ""development"", ""a"", ""cross"", ""linguistic"", ""investigation"")","c(""<h4>purpose<"", ""h4>"", ""plexity"", ""approach"", ""to"", ""speech"", ""disorders"", ""based"", ""on"", """", ""oretical"", ""ion"", ""of"", ""phonological"", ""markedness"", """", """", ""gaining"", ""interest"", """", ""last"", ""decade"", ""in"", ""a"", ""nutshell"", """", ""suggests"", """", ""acquisition"", ""phonologicy"", ""marked"", ""un"", ""e"", ""g"", ""plex"", ""ons"", ""implies"", ""less"", ""s"", ""singleton"", ""however"", ""beca"", ""is"", ""elf"", ""subject"", ""contrsies"", ""we"", ""need"", ""constrain"", ""what"",

"33970835","""Just Engage in It or Not, You Get Out What You Put In"": Student and Staff Experiences of Feedback and Feedforward in Workplace-Based Learning Environments.","Feedback is central to student learning in the veterinary workplace. Feedforward, a related concept, is used to describe the way information about a student's performance may be used to improve their future performance. Feedback and feedforward practices are diverse, with varied student and staff understandings of the nature and purpose of feedback (feedback literacy). This study compared the practices of feedback and feedforward in a range of programs in one institution during student transitions from the classroom to workplace-based learning environments. The study adopted a broad inter-professional approach to include health care programs as well as social work and theater and performance studies. Profession-specific focus groups were conducted with contribution from 28 students and 31 staff from five different professions. Thematic analysis revealed that students and staff shared an understanding of the feedback and feedforward concepts, and both groups recognized the importance of emotional and relational aspects of the process. Students and staff across all professions recognized the impact of time constraints on the feedback process, although this was particularly highlighted in the health science professions. Social work and theater and performance studies students demonstrated a more nuanced understanding of the emotional and relational aspects of feedback and feedforward. Overall, the approach highlights similarities and differences in practices and experiences in different workplace contexts, creating opportunities for cross-disciplinary learning, which may have relevance more widely in higher education programs with workplace-based elements.

"31429284","One Thousand and One Software for Proteomics: Tales of the Toolmakers of Science.","Proteomics is a highly dynamic field driven by frequent introduction of new technological approaches, leading to high demand for new software tools and the concurrent development of many methods for data analysis, processing, and storage. The rapidly changing landscape of proteomics software makes finding a tool fit for a particular purpose a significant challenge. The comparison of software and the selection of tools capable to perform a certain operation on a given type of data rely on their detailed annotation using well-defined descriptors. However, finding accurate information including tool input/output capabilities can be challenging and often heavily depends on manual curation efforts. This is further hampered by a rather low half-life of most of the tools, thus demanding the maintenance of a resource with updated information about the tools. We present here our approach to curate a collection of 189 software tools with detailed information about their functional capabilities. We furthermore describe our efforts to reach out to the proteomics community for their engagement, which further increased the catalog to >750 tools being about 70% of the estimated number of 1097 tools existing for proteomics data analysis.

The goal of PhenX is to facilitate the use of standard measures, enhance data interoperability, and promote collaborative and translational research. PhenX is driven by the scientific community and historically has depended on working groups of experts to recommend measures for release in the PhenX Toolkit. The urgent need for recommended, standard measures for COVID-19 research triggered the development of a ""rapid release"" process for releasing new content in the PhenX Toolkit. Initially, PhenX collaborated with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, the National Human Genome Research Institute, and the NIH Disaster Research Response (DR2) program to create a library of COVID-19 measurement protocols. With additional support from NIH, PhenX adapted crowdsourcing techniques to accelerate prioritization and recommendation of protocols for release in the PhenX Toolkit. Prioritized COVID-19-specific protocols were used to anchor and define specialty collections of protocols that were subject to review and approval by the PhenX Steering Committee. In addition to the COVID-19-specific protocols, the specialty collections include existing, well-established PhenX protocols, use of which will further enhance data interoperability and cross-study analysis. The COVID-19 specialty collections are Behaviors and Risks; Ethnicity, Race and Demographics; History, Treatment and Outcomes; Information Resources; Psychosocial and Mental Health; and Socioeconomic.

It will retrospectively and prospectively collect information from 3000 patients enrolled in 5 health care organizations. Information will be obtained from electronic health records, and from extended annual and brief questionnaires completed by patients before clinic visits. Core variables to be collected into the APEX COPD registry were agreed on by Delphi consensus and fall into 3 domains: demographics, COPD monitoring, and treatment. Main strengths of the registry include: 1) its size and scope (in terms of patient numbers, geographic spread and use of multiple information sources including patient-reported information); 2) collection of variables which are clinically relevant and practical to collect within primary care; 3) use of electronic data capture systems to ensure high-quality data and minimization of data-entry requirements; 4) inclusion of clinical, database development, management and communication experts; 5) regular sharing of key findings, both at international/national congresses and in peer-reviewed publications; and 6) a robust organizational structure to ensure continuance of the registry, and that research outputs are ethical, relevant and continue to bring value to both patients and physicians.","https://www.apexcopd.org/)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c("""", """", ""apexcopd"", """")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""advancing"", """", ""patient"", ""experience"", ""apex"", ""in"", ""copd"", ""registry"", ""study"", ""design"", """", ""strengths"")","c("""", ""advancing"", ""patient"", ""experience"", ""apex"", ""in"", ""chronic"", ""obstructive"", ""pulmonary"", ""disease"", ""copd"", ""registry"", """", """", ""apexcopd"", """", ""is"", ""first"", ""primary"", ""c"", ""health"", ""system"", ""based"", ""united"", ""states"", ""while"", """", ""ultimate"", ""goal"", ""to"", ""improve"", ""of"", ""patients"", ""diagnosed"", """", """", ""designed"", ""describe"", ""real"", ""life"", ""experiences"", ""people"", ""track"", ""key"", ""outes"", ""longitudiny"", """", ""assess"", ""effectiveness"", ""interventions"",

Ultimately, such models should also incorporate genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying brain structure and function, although currently this area is poorly specified. To this end, we are reporting here a multi-site, multi-modal dataset that captures cognitive function, brain structure and function, and genetic and epigenetic measures to better quantify the factors that influence brain development in children originally aged 9-14 years.

The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR¬Æ) standard which is overcoming the interoperability problems in health information exchange was extended to evidence-based medicine (EBM) knowledge with the EBMonFHIR project. A 13-step Code System Development Protocol was created in September 2020 to support global development of terminologies for exchange of scientific evidence. For Step 1, we assembled expert working groups with 55 people from 26 countries by October 2020. For Step 2, we identified 23 commonly used tools and systems for which the first version of code systems will be developed. For Step 3, a total of 368 non-redundant concepts were drafted to become display terms for four code systems (Statistic Type, Statistic Model, Study Design, Risk of Bias). Steps 4 through 13 will guide ongoing development and maintenance of these terminologies for scientific exchange. When completed, the code systems will facilitate identifying, processing, and reporting research results and the reliability of those results. More efficient and detailed scientific communication will reduce cost and burden and improve health outcomes, quality of life, and patient, caregiver, and healthcare professional satisfaction.

"32915954","PanGPCR: predictions for multiple targets, repurposing and side effects.","<h4>Summary</h4>Drug discovery targeting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest known class of therapeutic targets, is challenging. To facilitate the rapid discovery and development of GPCR drugs, we built a system, PanGPCR, to predict multiple potential GPCR targets and their expression locations in the tissues, side effects and possible repurposing of GPCR drugs. With PanGPCR, the compound of interest is docked to a library of 36 experimentally determined crystal structures comprising of 46 docking sites for human GPCRs, and a ranked list is generated from the docking studies to assess all GPCRs and their binding affinities.

"32976679","Spage2vec: Unsupervised representation of localized spatial gene expression signatures.","Investigations of spatial cellular composition of tissue architectures revealed by multiplexed in situ RNA detection often rely on inaccurate cell segmentation or prior biological knowledge from complementary single-cell sequencing experiments. Here, we present spage2vec, an unsupervised segmentation-free approach for decrypting the spatial transcriptomic heterogeneity of complex tissues at subcellular resolution. Spage2vec represents the spatial transcriptomic landscape of tissue samples as a graph and leverages a powerful machine learning graph representation technique to create a lower dimensional representation of local spatial gene expression. We apply spage2vec to mouse brain data from three different in situ transcriptomic assays and to a spatial gene expression dataset consisting of hundreds of individual cells. We show that learned representations encode meaningful biological spatial information of re-occurring localized gene expression signatures involved in cellular and subcellular processes.

"34023895","LigAdvisor: a versatile and user-friendly web-platform for drug design.","Although several tools facilitating in silico drug design are available, their results are usually difficult to integrate with publicly available information or require further processing to be fully exploited. The rational design of multi-target ligands (polypharmacology) and the repositioning of known drugs towards unmet therapeutic needs (drug repurposing) have raised increasing attention in drug discovery, although they usually require careful planning of tailored drug design strategies. Computational tools and data-driven approaches can help to reveal novel valuable opportunities in these contexts, as they enable to efficiently mine publicly available chemical, biological, clinical, and disease-related data. Based on these premises, we developed LigAdvisor, a data-driven webserver which integrates information reported in DrugBank, Protein Data Bank, UniProt, Clinical Trials and Therapeutic Target Database into an intuitive platform, to facilitate drug discovery tasks as drug repurposing, polypharmacology, target fishing and profiling. As designed, LigAdvisor enables easy integration of similarity estimation results with clinical data, thereby allowing a more efficient exploitation of information in different drug discovery contexts.

This poses significant obstacles for smaller laboratories, or laboratories not affiliated with larger projects, which may not have dedicated bioinformatics staff or computing power to effectively use genomic data to protect public health. Building on the success of the cloud-based Galaxy bioinformatics platform ( http://galaxyproject.org ), already known for its user-friendliness and powerful WGS analytical tools, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) created a customized 'instance' of the Galaxy environment, called GalaxyTrakr ( https://www.galaxytrakr.org ), for use by laboratory scientists performing food-safety regulatory research. The goal was to enable laboratories outside of the FDA internal network to (1) perform quality assessments of sequence data, (2) identify links between clinical isolates and positive food/environmental samples, including those at the National Center for Biotechnology Information sequence read archive ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/ ), and (3) explore new methodologies such as metagenomics. GalaxyTrakr hosts a variety of free and adaptable tools and provides the data storage and computing power to run the tools. These tools support coordinated analytic methods and consistent interpretation of results across laboratories. Users can create and share tools for their specific needs and use sequence data generated locally and elsewhere.<h4>Results</h4>In its first full year (2018), GalaxyTrakr processed over 85,000 jobs and went from 25 to 250 users, representing 53 different public and state health laboratories, academic institutions, international health laboratories, and federal organizations. By mid-2020, it has grown to 600 registered users and processed over 450,000 analytical jobs. To illustrate how laboratories are making use of this resource, we describe how six institutions use GalaxyTrakr to quickly analyze and review their data. Instructions for participating in GalaxyTrakr are provided.<h4>Conclusions</h4>GalaxyTrakr advances food safety by providing reliable and harmonized WGS analyses for public health laboratories and promoting collaboration across laboratories with differing resources. Anticipated enhancements to this resource will include workflows for additional foodborne pathogens, viruses, and parasites, as well as new tools and services.","c(""http://galaxyproject.org""","""https://www.galaxytrakr.org""","""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""c"", """", ""galaxyproject"", """")","c("""", """", """", ""galaxytrakr"", """")","c("""", """", """", ""ncbi"", ""nlm"", ""nih"", ""gov"", ""sra"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""galaxytrakr"", ""a"", ""distributed"", ""analysis"", """", """", ""public"", ""health"", ""whole"", ""genome"", ""sequence"", """", ""accessible"", ""to"", ""non"", ""bioinmaticians"")","c(""<h4>background<"", ""h4>processing"", """", ""analyzing"", ""whole"", ""genome"", ""sequencing"", ""wgs"", ""is"", ""putationy"", ""intense"", ""a"", ""single"", ""illumina"", ""miseq"", ""run"", ""produces"", ""äâ~"", ""äâ1"", ""million"", ""250"", ""base"", ""pair"", ""reads"", """", """", ""of"", ""24"", ""samples"", """", ""poses"", ""signifit"", ""obstacles"", ""smer"", ""laboratories"", ""or"", """", ""affiliated"", """", ""larger"", ""projects"", ""which"", ""may"", """", ""dedicated"", ""bioinmatics"", ""staff"", ""puting"", ""power"",

"33087719","Density functional theory-based electric field gradient database.","The deviation of the electron density around the nuclei from spherical symmetry determines the electric field gradient (EFG), which can be measured by various types of spectroscopy. Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR) is particularly sensitive to the EFG. The EFGs, and by implication NQR frequencies, vary dramatically across materials. Consequently, searching for NQR spectral lines in previously uninvestigated materials represents a major challenge. Calculated EFGs can significantly aid at the search's inception. To facilitate this task, we have applied high-throughput density functional theory calculations to predict EFGs for 15187 materials in the JARVIS-DFT database. This database, which will include EFG as a standard entry, is continuously increasing. Given the large scope of the database, it is impractical to verify each calculation. However, we assess accuracy by singling out cases for which reliable experimental information is readily available and compare them to the calculations. We further present a statistical analysis of the results. The database and tools associated with our work are made publicly available by JARVIS-DFT ( https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/~knc6/JVASP.html ) and NIST-JARVIS API ( http://jarvis.nist.gov/ ).","c(""https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/""","""http://jarvis.nist.gov/"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""c"", """", """", ""ctcms"", ""nist"", ""gov"")","c("""", """", ""jarvis"", ""nist"", ""gov"")",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"c(""density"", ""functional"", ""ory"", ""based"", ""electric"", ""field"", ""gradient"", ""base"")","c("""", ""deviation"", ""of"", ""electron"", ""density"", ""around"", ""nuclei"", """", ""spherical"", ""symmetry"", ""determines"", ""electric"", ""field"", ""gradient"", ""efg"", ""which"", """", ""be"", ""measured"", ""by"", ""various"", ""types"", ""spectroscopy"", ""nuclear"", ""quadrupole"", ""resonance"", ""nqr"", ""is"", ""particularly"", ""sensitive"", ""to"", ""efgs"", """", ""implication"", ""frequencies"", ""vary"", ""dramaticy"", ""across"", ""materials"", ""consequently"", ""searching"", """", ""spectral"", ""lines"", ""in"", ""previously"", ""uninvestigated"",

"34048547","emiRIT: a text-mining-based resource for microRNA information.","microRNAs (miRNAs) are essential gene regulators, and their dysregulation often leads to diseases. Easy access to miRNA information is crucial for interpreting generated experimental data, connecting facts across publications and developing new hypotheses built on previous knowledge. Here, we present extracting miRNA Information from Text (emiRIT), a text-miningbased resource, which presents miRNA information mined from the literature through a user-friendly interface. We collected 149‚Äâ,233 miRNA -PubMed ID pairs from Medline between January 1997 and May 2020. emiRIT currently contains 'miRNA -gene regulation' (69‚Äâ,152 relations), 'miRNA disease (cancer)' (12‚Äâ,300 relations), 'miRNA -biological process and pathways' (23, 390 relations) and circulatory 'miRNAs in extracellular locations' (3782 relations). Biological entities and their relation to miRNAs were extracted from Medline abstracts using publicly available and in-house developed text-mining tools, and the entities were normalized to facilitate querying and integration. We built a database and an interface to store and access the integrated data, respectively. We provide an up-to-date and user-friendly resource to facilitate access to comprehensive miRNA information from the literature on a large scale, enabling users to navigate through different roles of miRNA and examine them in a context specific to their information needs. To assess our resource's information coverage, we have conducted two case studies focusing on the target and differential expression information of miRNAs in the context of cancer and a third case study to assess the usage of emiRIT in the curation of miRNA information.
